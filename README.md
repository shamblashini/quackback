## Get Started

**Cloud** — start free at [app.quackback.io](https://app.quackback.io/signup). We host, scale, and maintain it for you. No setup required.

**Self-hosted** anywhere with [Docker](#docker) or [one click on Railway](#one-click-deploy).

## Why Quackback?

Most support-and-feedback suites are expensive, closed-source, and lock you in. Quackback is the suite you actually own: feedback, shared inbox, help center, changelog, status, and AI.

- **Self-host for free.** Run on your own infrastructure. No per-seat pricing.
- **Own your data.** Feedback, conversations, and knowledge live in your own database. No vendor lock-in.
- **AI-powered.** Automatic duplicate detection, AI summaries, feedback extraction from external sources, and an [MCP server](https://quackback.io/docs/mcp) that lets AI agents search, triage, and act on feedback directly.
- **25 integrations.** Slack, Linear, Jira, GitHub, Intercom, Zendesk, and [more](#integrations) out of the box.

## Features

- **Feedback boards.** Let users vote, comment, and track status on feature requests. Vote on behalf of customers, surface high-revenue accounts in triage, and see a full activity timeline on every post.
- **Quinn AI.** A customer-facing agent and a teammate Copilot. Detect duplicates, summarize themes, connect remote MCP servers as Connectors, and permission every write tool: always allow, ask for approval, or deny.
- **Embeddable widget.** Collect feedback right inside your app with a [drop-in widget](https://quackback.io/docs/widget/installation). Works on desktop and mobile, with native SDKs for [iOS](https://github.com/QuackbackIO/quackback-ios) and [Android](https://github.com/QuackbackIO/quackback-android).
- **Admin inbox.** Triage incoming feedback in one place. Filter, group, dismiss, and restore deleted posts.
- **Roadmap & changelog.** Show users what's planned, in progress, and shipped. Publish updates and schedule posts for later.
- **Integrations.** [25 integrations](#integrations) including Slack, Linear, Jira, GitHub, Intercom, Zendesk, and two-way issue tracker sync.
- **API, webhooks & MCP.** Automate workflows with the REST API, outbound webhooks, and an [MCP server](https://quackback.io/docs/mcp) for AI agents.
- **Internationalization.** Portal and widget available in English, French, German, Spanish, Portuguese (Brazil), Russian, Ukrainian, Chinese (Simplified and Traditional), and Arabic with full RTL support. Auto-detects browser language.
- **Flexible auth.** Password, email OTP, Google, GitHub, and SSO with providers like Okta and Auth0.
- **SEO-ready.** Auto-generated sitemap and social sharing previews on every portal page.

## Integrations

Slack, Linear, Jira, GitHub, GitLab, Asana, ClickUp, Monday, Trello, Notion, Shortcut, Azure DevOps, Intercom, Zendesk, Freshdesk, HubSpot, Salesforce, Stripe, Discord, Teams, Segment, Zapier, Make, and n8n.

## Self-Hosted

### One-Click Deploy

[![Deploy on Railway](https://railway.com/button.svg)](https://railway.com/deploy/quackback?referralCode=ez8Slg&utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=deploy-button)

### Docker

```bash
git clone https://github.com/QuackbackIO/quackback.git
cd quackback
cp .env.example .env   # Edit with your configuration
docker build -t quackback -f apps/web/Dockerfile .
docker run -p 3000:3000 --env-file .env quackback
```

Requires PostgreSQL. Set all variables in the canonical [runtime configuration table](docs/configuration.md). Migrations run automatically on startup.

### About the cloud code in this repo

Quackback's hosted service runs this same codebase, and the client side of that arrangement lives here: a default-off `cloud` settings block, plan and entitlement gating, and a control-plane client. On a self-hosted install none of it activates — an install with no cloud configuration is entitled to every feature, no upgrade prompts render, and no outbound requests are made. Disabling is the default; there is nothing to opt out of. This is stated here so you never have to discover it in the code first.
