/**
 * Amazon SES v2 sending transport.
 *
 * One `SendEmail` call over the AWS SDK, reachable from any backend, which is
 * what makes it usable from a container tier. DKIM signing, the account
 * suppression list, and the delivery event stream are all on the AWS side of
 * the call.
 *
 * The sending identity has to be verified in SES, but verification is a DNS
 * record the domain's owner publishes — SES does not have to host the zone. A
 * customer-owned domain on someone else's DNS can therefore be signed for here,
 * which is why this transport has no notion of a domain it must refuse to send
 * as, and why the caller has no rung below it for one.
 *
 * ## What this transport cannot do
 *
 * `Message-ID` is platform-controlled. SES generates it and returns the
 * assigned id on the response; a caller-supplied one is REPLACED on the way out
 * (not duplicated, and before the message is signed) along with Date,
 * MIME-Version, Content-Type, Return-Path, DKIM-Signature and the ARC set.
 * Anything that needs to pin its own outbound Message-ID (the conversation
 * email channel's threading does) has to read the assigned id back off the
 * response instead of choosing it. `In-Reply-To`, `References`, `List-*`,
 * `Auto-Submitted`, `Precedence` and any `X-*` header are accepted and pass
 * through untouched.
 *
 * The assigned id is reported BARE, exactly as the API gives it, because that
 * is the only form of it we are told; the header the provider signs carries the
 * same id at a regional host. Reconciling the two forms is the store's job, not
 * this transport's. The one thing this transport does with the host is complete
 * the threading tokens it is asked to send, since a bare id is not a legal
 * `msg-id`, and that is the only place the host appears at all. See
 * `message-id.ts` for why that split is deliberate.

/**
 * Send one message. Throws `SesEmailError` on any outcome that is not a clean
 * hand-off.
 *
 * Acceptance is the assigned message id, not the absence of an exception. SES
 * answers a successful `SendEmail` with exactly one field, `MessageId`, and it
 * is the provider's receipt: the id exists because the message was queued for
 * delivery. A 2xx carrying no id is therefore not a send we can report, and it
 * is counted as a failure rather than reported as a success with nothing to
 * show for it.
 *
 * The rule is deliberately about that one field and no more. A field a provider
 * fills only sometimes — a per-recipient delivery group, say — looks like
 * stronger evidence and is not: demanding it turns every real send into a
 * rejection. Evidence is only worth requiring when it is what acceptance
 * actually produces.
