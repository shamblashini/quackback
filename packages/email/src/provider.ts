/**
 * Which provider carries outbound mail, decided from the environment alone.
 *
 * Exactly one sending provider may be configured. An install holding two sets
 * of credentials has not said which one it means, and any order this module
 * picked would be a guess that silently sends through the account the operator
 * least expects (or stops sending through the one they set up first when a
 * second appears). So more than one is refused, naming the variables, and the
 * process refuses to start on it (see `assertEmailProviderConfigured`).
 *
 * The one exception is the Resend key's second job. It also fetches the bodies
 * of inbound mail delivered by Resend's webhook, so an install receiving
 * through Resend while sending through SES or SMTP holds it legitimately. That
 * is said out loud with `EMAIL_INBOUND_PROVIDER=resend`, and only then is the
 * key left out of the count. A lone Resend key sends whatever that variable says.

 * — and a missing environment variable is not something a second attempt
 * supplies. Without the marker a misconfiguration spends the whole backoff
 * before failing exactly as it did on the first try.
