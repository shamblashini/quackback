/**
 * A per-process pace for outbound sends.
 *
 * A provider account has one sending rate, and a bulk notification (a
 * changelog going to every subscriber) fans out into one job per recipient that
 * the queue runs as fast as its concurrency allows. Unpaced, that burst is the
 * provider's rate limit, met head on; paced, it is the same mail a little later.
 *
 * ## Shape
 *
 * Virtual scheduling rather than a token bucket. Each caller is handed the next
 * free slot at the moment it asks (`max(now, last slot + interval)`) and sleeps
 * until then, so sends leave exactly one interval apart with no burst allowance:
 * a bucket that starts full lets `rate` sends out at once and `rate` more in the
 * following second, which is twice the rate inside one window and the shape a
 * per-second limit counts.
 *
 * - **Order.** Slots are handed out in call order and never revisited, so sends
 *   leave in the order they asked; nobody can be overtaken and starve.
 * - **No lock.** A caller holds nothing while it waits: it owns one timer and
 *   one slot, so there is nothing for two waiters to deadlock on.
 * - **Bounded.** A caller whose slot would be more than `maxWaitMs` away is
 *   refused at once instead of queued, and reserves nothing. The state is one
 *   number, and the most callers ever parked is `maxWaitMs × rate` (a 5,000-send
 *   burst at 10/s with a 30s cap parks 300 and turns 4,700 away).
 *
 * The clock is monotonic (`performance.now`), so a wall-clock step cannot
 * release a line early or freeze it.
