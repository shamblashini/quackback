 * Proves control of an address someone is adding to, or moving, their account.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT the sign-in template. That one is headed "Sign in to
 * Quackback", and showing it to someone who just asked to change their address
 * reads as a phishing attempt — the action they took and the mail they received
 * would not match. Same code presentation, different sentence.
 *
 * There is no link. The person is already in the app, on the page that asked
 * for the address, so a code they type back keeps them in that context and
 * gives a cross-device link no chance to be intercepted.
