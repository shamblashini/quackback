/**
 * A stable identity for one logical send, carried to the provider so a retry
 * of the same send is delivered once.
 *
 * Retries live above this package: the conversation path retries a failed send
 * in a loop, and the event hook queue re-runs a failed hook job. Both can retry
 * a send the provider in fact accepted (a timeout after acceptance, a 5xx from
 * an edge), and without a key the provider has no way to know the second
 * request is the first one again. The retrying caller is the only party that
 * knows which attempts belong to one send, so it opens the scope and every
 * send inside it carries the same key, whichever sender function it calls.
 *
 * Scoped by async context rather than threaded through each sender's
 * parameters: the hook runs a dozen differently-shaped senders, and the key is
 * a property of the attempt loop around them, not of any one message.
