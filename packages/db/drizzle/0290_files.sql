-- @contract: additive
-- Uploaded files attached to conversation and ticket messages. A row is written
-- when an upload finishes, before the message exists; message_id is set when it
-- is sent, and the retention sweep removes files that never were. content_type,
-- family and size are read from the stored bytes, not the sender's claim.
