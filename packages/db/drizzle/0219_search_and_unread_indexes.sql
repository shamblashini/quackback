-- Two read-path indexes surfaced by a data-layer performance audit. The one
-- built here is idempotent (IF NOT EXISTS) so re-runs on long-lived dev
-- databases no-op.
--
-- 1. user.name trigram GIN index (user_name_trgm_idx). The admin people-search
--    runs
--       WHERE name ILIKE '%term%'
--    (users/user.service.ts, principal.service.ts). A leading-wildcard ILIKE
--    cannot use a btree, so it mirrors principal_display_name_trgm_idx with a
--    gin_trgm_ops index. It is not built here: "user" holds every anonymous
--    widget visitor, and a build inside the migration transaction would lock
--    and scan it for the whole upgrade. It is built CONCURRENTLY after the
--    migrations commit, from CONCURRENT_INDEX_SPECS in
--    packages/db/src/schema-ops.ts (fresh installs and upgrades alike).
--
-- 2. conversation_messages unread-count partial index. The inbox list's batched
--    unread query (conversation.query.ts) counts visitor-authored, non-internal,
--    live messages per conversation, comparing created_at against the agent's
--    last-read watermark. The partial predicate matches those fixed filters
--    exactly, keeping the index to the relevant sliver; (conversation_id,
--    created_at) serves both the IN grouping and the watermark range check. Built
--    as a plain btree in the transactional path, matching how the sibling
--    conversation_messages_style_mining_idx partial index (0173) was created.
