/**
 * The migration executor, callable from anywhere that holds a connection
 * string — the CLI entrypoint, a provisioning path, or the fleet migrator role
 * (SAAS-HOSTING-STACK.md §10.3).
 *
 * ## What this used to be, and what it was missing
 *
 * This function existed already and was already parameterised by connection
 * string, already idempotent, already chaining `migrate()` into
 * `seedSystemData()`. Three gaps were measured against live workspaces on
 * 2026-08-08, and the first was worse than a gap:
 *
 * 1. **It never issued `CREATE EXTENSION vector`, and no migration file does
 *    either, while `0000_initial` declares `vector` columns.** A fresh database
 *    migrated through this path could not succeed at all. Only the `migrate.ts`
 *    CLI created the extension.
 * 2. **It never called the concurrent-index step**, so the 4 HNSW and 3 trigram
 *    indexes silently did not exist. No error — an absent index is not an error,
 *    it is a slow workspace.
 * 3. **An interrupted `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY` leaves an *invalid* index**,
 *    `IF NOT EXISTS` then treats it as present, and the next run exits 0. So the
 *    heal cannot be "re-run and hope": invalid indexes are dropped *before* the
 *    build, and post-conditions are verified *after* against the catalogue.
 *
 * ## Atomicity, and exactly where it stops
 *
 * `migrate()` wraps the whole loop in one transaction (drizzle-orm@0.45.2), so
 * the lineage is atomic — never partial. Everything around it is not: the
 * extension creation, the index builds and the seed each run outside that
 * transaction. A kill in the tail therefore leaves a **complete ledger and a
 * broken database**. That is why {@link RunMigrationsResult} reports the
 * post-condition verdict separately from the ledger, and why a caller must
 * never read "all migrations applied" as "the database is correct".
 *
 * ## Session mode, and what actually breaks
 *
 * Measured through a transaction-mode pooler rather than assumed, and the answer is
 * not the one usually given:
 *
 * - **`CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY` works through the pooler.** It is one
 *   statement to the client; the multi-transaction dance happens server-side
 *   where the pooler cannot see it. So "CIC cannot run through a pooler" is
 *   wrong, and a guard justified only by that would be justified by nothing.
 * - **`pg_advisory_lock` is where it breaks, and it breaks badly.** The lock is
 *   session-scoped, and a pooled client's "session" is a server connection the
 *   pooler keeps alive after the client disconnects. Measured: take the lock
 *   through the pooler, disconnect, and the lock is still held; and a client on
 *   the **direct** endpoint asking for that key blocks — verified by watching it
 *   die on a 10 s `lock_timeout` until the stranded backend was terminated by
 *   hand.
 * - **The mutual-exclusion failure is non-deterministic, not total.** A second
 *   pooled client got `pg_try_advisory_lock = true` for the held key — but
 *   because the pooler routed it onto the *same backend*, where it re-entered
 *   its own lock (hold count 2; the third unlock returned false). Forced onto a
 *   fresh backend it correctly returned false. So the mutex fails open depending
 *   on pool routing, which is worse than one that never works: it works in
 *   testing.
 *
 * So a migrator run through the pooler does not merely lose its own
 * serialisation: it strands a lock that wedges every subsequent direct run of
 * the same workspace. That is why the pooled endpoint is refused up front rather
 * than allowed to half-work — see {@link assertSessionModeDsn}.

   * The hazard is specific and was hit against the live fleet. `0250_job_queue`
   * contains `DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS job_queue_wake_trg ON job_queue`, which
   * needs ACCESS EXCLUSIVE on `job_queue` — a table the worker tier's poller
   * holds ROW EXCLUSIVE on continuously. The migration transaction has already
   * touched `job_queue` by then, so it is asking to *upgrade* a lock it holds
   * while another session holds a conflicting one, which is the classic shape of
   * a deadlock rather than a wait. Postgres detects it and kills one side after
   * `deadlock_timeout`, and which side loses is not ours to choose.
   *
   * A timeout does not prevent the contention; it bounds it. The lineage is one
   * transaction, so a `55P03` rolls the whole run back and changes nothing, the
   * reconciler records the failure with its diagnosis, and the lease's own
   * backoff retries — which is a better retry than a new one here, because it
   * counts against `max_attempts` and therefore cannot loop forever against a
