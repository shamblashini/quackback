/**
 * The external side-effect ledger.
 *
 * A database restore rewinds internal state. It cannot rewind an email that
 * was already sent, a webhook that was already delivered, or a changelog that
 * was already announced. Every column that records "we already did an
 * externally visible thing" becomes a lie the moment the rows around it are
 * rewound, and the next scheduler tick believes the lie and does the thing
 * again: the subscriber list gets the whole backlog a second time, the
 * receiver gets every webhook in the restored window a second time, a resend
 * cooldown that had not expired is suddenly open again.
 *
 * This file is the one place that decides, per column, what a restore should
 * do about it. `settleExternalSideEffects` (settle-external-side-effects.ts)
 * is the only consumer; it applies every policy here in a single transaction.
 *
 * The registry is keyed per COLUMN, never per table, because one table
 * routinely carries both kinds. `changelog_entries.published_at` is content
 * state and must come back exactly as it was; `changelog_entries.notified_at`
 * on the same row is a delivery receipt and must be settled or the backlog is
 * re-announced. Migration 0120 backfilled `notified_at` for precisely this
 * reason, arriving from a different direction.
 *
 * ## Adding a column
 *
 * The guard test (`__tests__/side-effect-ledger.test.ts`) fails when a
 * ledger-shaped column exists in the schema and appears in neither
 * `SIDE_EFFECT_LEDGER` nor `SIDE_EFFECT_LEDGER_EXEMPTIONS`. To classify one,
 * find the query that READS it and ask what a rewind makes that query do:
 *
 * - A scheduler drains rows where it IS NULL, and draining sends something
 *   outbound -> `settle` with `'stamp-pending'`.
 * - It is a rate-limit or cooldown watermark, so an older value re-opens a
 *   window -> `settle` with `'restart-window'`.
 * - It is the data itself, or restoring it verbatim is what the operator
 *   wants -> `preserve`.
 * - It is internal freshness telemetry whose pre-restore value is not
 *   evidence about the live system -> `reset`.
 * - Nothing reads it, or it is not a record of an external action at all ->
 *   `SIDE_EFFECT_LEDGER_EXEMPTIONS`, with a reason naming what would have to
 *   change for it to become a hazard.
 *
 * The `reason` is load-bearing. It is what the next engineer reads to
 * classify their own column, so name the consumer and the consequence, not
 * the policy.

 *                    the historical record of when the effect happened
