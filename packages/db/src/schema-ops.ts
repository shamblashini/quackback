/**
 * The schema steps that live *outside* drizzle's migration transaction.
 *
 * `migrate()` wraps the whole migration loop in one `session.transaction()`
 * (drizzle-orm@0.45.2), so the lineage is atomic: measured kills at 1.0/1.5/2.0/
 * 2.5 s leave `applied=0, tables=0` and kills at 3.0/3.5 s leave `226/147`,
 * never a partial. That is a real property and a reconciler can inherit it.
 *
 * **But only `migrate()` is atomic.** Extension creation, the concurrent index
 * builds and `seedSystemData()` all run outside that transaction, so a kill in
 * the tail leaves every migration applied *and* the database wrong. The ledger
 * will happily report success. Everything in this module exists because of that
 * gap:
 *
 * | Step | Why it is here |
 * | --- | --- |
 * | {@link ensureExtensions} | `runMigrations()` never issued `CREATE EXTENSION vector`, and no migration file does either, while `0000_initial` declares `vector` columns. A fresh database migrated through the runtime path could not succeed at all. |
 * | {@link dropInvalidIndexes} | An interrupted `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY` leaves an *invalid* index. `IF NOT EXISTS` then treats it as present, so the next run skips it and exits 0 — leaving it INVALID forever. Healing has to happen *before* the build, not by re-running and hoping. |
 * | {@link ensureConcurrentIndexes} | Never called by the runtime path at all. Without it the 4 HNSW and 3 trigram indexes silently do not exist: no error, just a slow workspace. |
 * | {@link verifySchemaPostconditions} | The ledger is not evidence. Post-conditions have to be checked against the catalogue, independently of what `drizzle.__drizzle_migrations` claims. |
 *
 * ## Why this module exists as a module
 *
 * `ensureConcurrentIndexes` used to be a private function inside `migrate.ts`,
 * and `migrate.ts` calls `runMigrations()` at its top level — so importing it to
 * reuse the function ran migrations as a side effect. Any migrator role built on
 * it had to either shell out to the CLI or duplicate the index list. Both were
 * worse than moving the steps into a leaf module that `migrate.ts` imports: one
 * list, two consumers, no duplication to drift.
 *
 * Everything here takes a `postgres.Sql` rather than a `Database`, because
 * `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY` cannot run inside a transaction block and the
 * drizzle wrapper is not the right handle for a statement with that constraint.

 * 1. **The `indisvalid` sweep.** Every index in every user schema. No list of

 *    of — a future migration's, a partition's, an operator's.
 * 2. **Presence of the concurrent indexes.** The one thing the sweep cannot see:
 *    an index that was never built is not invalid, it is absent, and absence is
 *    silent. Derived from {@link CONCURRENT_INDEX_SPECS} — the same list the
 *    creator uses, so it cannot drift out of step with it.
 * 3. **Extensions.** A dropped `vector` makes every embedding column
 *    unqueryable while the ledger still reads complete.
 * 4. **The shape this build queries with.** Every table and column
 *    {@link declaredTables} names must exist. Added because checks 1–3 returned

 *    500'd on every page: the ledger said complete, the post-conditions said
 *    correct, and the workspace was down. Drizzle emits explicit column lists, so a
 *    declared column that does not exist is not a missing value, it is a throw.
 *
 * **What it still does not cover, stated so a green verdict is readable.** Types,
 * nullability, defaults, constraints, triggers and functions are not compared,
 * and objects the database has but this build does not declare are ignored on
 * purpose — a workspace a newer image has already migrated past must keep being
 * served (§10.2), so extra is never a violation. Full bidirectional comparison
 * is what `db:check-drift` is for, and it needs the Drizzle Kit toolchain rather
