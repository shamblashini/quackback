/**
 * The CLI entrypoint. `docker-entrypoint.sh` runs this at boot, and the control
 * plane's provisioning path shells out to it.
 *
 * It is deliberately a thin wrapper over {@link runMigrations} rather than a
 * second implementation. The extension creation, the invalid-index heal, the
 * concurrent index build and the post-condition sweep all used to live here as
 * private code, which is exactly why a migrator role could not reuse them:
 * importing this file to reach them ran migrations as a side effect. One
 * executor, two entrypoints.
 *
 * Two deliberate differences from the fleet migrator role:
 *
 * - **Session-mode is not enforced here.** This CLI has always run against
 *   whatever `DATABASE_URL` names, including a self-hosted install behind a
 *   connection pooler. Refusing that at boot would turn a working deployment
 *   into a crash loop over a property it has been getting away with for years.
 *   The fleet migrator does enforce it, because there the direct endpoint is a
 *   field on the workspace record and there is no excuse for using the other one.
 * - **A post-condition violation is loud but not fatal.** This process's job is
 *   to make the database servable, and an absent HNSW index makes a workspace slow,
 *   not broken; exiting non-zero would refuse to boot over a performance
 *   regression. The reconciler treats the same violation as a failed reconcile,
 *   because there it has somewhere to record it and something else to try.
