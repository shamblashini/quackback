/**
 * P09 — the assistant's service principal id from alpha written into bravo's rows.
 *
 * `assistant.orchestrator.ts:62` memoises `memoizedAssistantPrincipalId` in
 * module scope, with a sibling memo in `messages/assistant-principal.ts:16-17`.
 * The value is a `principal.id` from whichever workspace's database happened to be
 * resolved first after boot. SAAS-HOSTING-STACK.md §4.1 spells out the
 * consequence: it is then written as a foreign key into another workspace's
 * `conversation_messages`, `assistant_involvements` and workflow action rows —
 * "FK violation, or silent misattribution".
 *
 * Silent misattribution is the case worth catching. If bravo happens to hold a
 * principal row with the same id — impossible today, entirely possible after a
 * restore, a clone, or a seeded fixture — the FK is satisfied and Quinn's
 * replies in bravo are attributed to a principal from alpha. Nothing errors.
