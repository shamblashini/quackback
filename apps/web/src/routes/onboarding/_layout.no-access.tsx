 * Every account is created with a principal, so "has a principal" never meant
 * "may finish setup": a non-owner used to walk the whole workspace form and be
 * refused by the bootstrap guard at the end, and a visitor with no principal
 * was sent to a sign-in route that the root gate bounced straight back into the
 * wizard, forever. Both now arrive here, where the only two things they can
 * actually do are offered: sign out and come back as the owner, or wait to be
 * invited.
