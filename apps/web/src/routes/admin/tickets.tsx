/**
 * Retired route (UNIFIED-INBOX-SPEC.md §2.2/§4): tickets are now rows in the
 * unified `/admin/inbox` list, not a standalone page. This route is kept
 * permanently as a redirect (not deleted) so old bookmarks/links keep working:
 * `?t=<id>` deep-links become `?i=<id>`; a bare visit opens the Tickets >
 * Customer scope. Mirrors the `c=` → `i=` alias `/admin/inbox` itself accepts.
 *
 * The redirect is thrown from `beforeLoad`, so a document request answers
 * with the redirect itself and the browser loads the inbox directly.
 *
 * The standalone ticket components (`TicketListColumn`, `TicketDetailPanel`, …)
 * are no longer imported here. `TicketDetail`/`ticket-thread.tsx` were deleted
 * in M4 (folded into the unified `agent-conversation-thread.tsx`); M5 folded
 * `TicketDetailPanel` into `inbox-detail-panel.tsx` and repurposed
 * `new-ticket-dialog.tsx` into `components/admin/inbox/create-ticket-dialog.tsx`
 * (still used, from the unified inbox); the rest are unused until M6 finishes
 * the cleanup pass (§4).
