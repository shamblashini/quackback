/**
 * Client-side reuse of the identity-bound route context.
 *
 * The router runs every matched route's beforeLoad on each navigation and on
 * each intent preload, and no run sees the last one's result. A person's click
 * is up to three of them: the hover preload, the preload the press's focus
 * queues, and the navigation itself. The root route's bootstrap payload and the
 * admin shell's role guard are server calls whose answers change only when the
 * viewer, their role or the workspace's settings do, so each click asked the
 * server the same questions up to three times, and every later click asked
 * again.
 *
 * A memo keeps one answer, shared with a call still in flight, until the first
 * of:
 *
 * - `expireRouteContext()`, which runs on every `router.invalidate()` (sign-in,
 *   sign-out and every settings or profile change already call it to refresh
 *   this context), after every server function called with POST (whatever this
 *   page changes, the next navigation sees; route-context-middleware.ts), and
 *   whenever Better Auth reports a session change;
 * - the page coming back into view, since another tab may have signed out or
 *   switched accounts meanwhile;
 * - {@link ROUTE_CONTEXT_MAX_AGE_MS}, a backstop for changes made elsewhere
 *   (a teammate editing settings, an admin changing this viewer's role) that
 *   nothing here can observe.
 *
 * A failed call is never kept. On the server nothing is kept at all: module
 * state there is shared by every request.
 *
 * A new answer keeps the previous answer's objects wherever it did not change
 * them (structural sharing), so a component that selected a part of the
 * context (the settings, the permission list) renders again only when that
 * part changed, not every time the context is asked for again.
