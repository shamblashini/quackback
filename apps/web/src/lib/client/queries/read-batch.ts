/**
 * One request for a route loader's reads.
 *
 * A route loader running in the browser (moving between settings pages, or
 * onto the public roadmap) sent each read it warmed as a request of its own,
 * each resolving the caller's session and permissions again. A loader that
 * warms its reads through `readBatch` instead sends the ones not yet cached
 * as one request (`readTogetherFn`), which runs each read's own query
 * function. Each result then fills that read's cache entry under its own key
 * and options, as fetching it alone would have.
 *
 * Nothing about a read's outcome changes. A read the batch could not answer
 * (a permission the caller lacks, an error, a read missing from
 * `lib/server/read-registry.ts`) is fetched on its own, so its error reaches
 * the loader exactly as before; the batch failing as a whole leaves every
 * read to its own fetch. In a document request the reads run in process, as
 * they always did, so there is nothing to batch.
