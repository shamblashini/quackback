/**
 * Query-key factory for conversation threads and lists across every surface:
 * the admin inbox, the portal Support tab, and the widget messenger. One
 * factory keeps SSE cache writes, invalidations, and SSR-prefetch hydration
 * pointing at the same keys (conversation-keys.test.ts pins them).
 *
 * Lives in lib (not the components/conversation module) so query factories
 * under lib/client/queries can consume it too — lib must not import from
 * components. The feature module re-exports it from query-keys.ts.
