/**
 * Workspace resolution middleware — the Host header decides the database.
 *
 * Registered immediately after `request-context.ts` and **before** everything
 * else, CSRF included. That ordering is the whole point of the piece:
 * `request-context.ts` has always enriched `workspace_key` "once auth resolves", but
 * auth resolution is itself full of `db.query.*` calls, so a workspace decided at
 * that moment is decided long after the connection it was supposed to choose.
 * This runs first, touches only the control database, and hands everything
 * downstream a workspace that is already verified.
 *
 * Under `QUACKBACK_TENANCY=single` this is a pass-through and the process
 * behaves exactly as it always has.
 *
 * ## What happens on each failure
 *
 * | Outcome | Status | Database touched |
 * | --- | --- | --- |
 * | `unknown_host` — no record claims this hostname | 404, "no workspace here" page | none |
 * | `redirect` — obsolete friendly platform hostname | 308 for GET/HEAD, 409 otherwise | none |
 * | `suspended` because deleted — in its restore window | 404, "isn't available" page | none |
 * | `suspended` for any other reason — paused | 503 + `Retry-After`, "paused" page; the reason is never shown | none |
 * | `deleting` — teardown in flight | 410, "isn't available" page | none |
 * | `invalid` — a record exists but fails the contract | 503, alert | none |
 * | `refused` — the database is not the one the record named | 503, alert | one query |
 * | `refused[schema_below_floor]` — right database, schema too old for this build | 503 + `Retry-After`, warn | one query |
 * | `refused[schema_floor_misconfigured]` — this process's own MIN_SCHEMA_VERSION is unresolvable | 503, alert | none |
 * | `refused[secret_key_canary_*]` — right database, wrong key | 503, alert naming the KEY, not the database | one query |
 * | `refused[*]` — credential, connectivity, anything else | 503, alert, NOT the fingerprint alarm | varies |
 *
 * Every one of them is a refusal to serve. None degrades to a default workspace,
 * because §3's failure mode is precisely that a wrong-but-plausible answer looks
 * correct all the way down.
