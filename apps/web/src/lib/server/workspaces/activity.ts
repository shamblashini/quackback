/**
 * Which pooled workspaces are worth running background work for.
 *
 * ## The problem
 *
 * The job worker ran a poll loop for every active registry workspace — a scope
 * open, a schedule tick and a `job_queue` claim every few seconds, plus a dozen
 * cron enqueues an hour, plus every fleet sweep (`runFleetPass`) opening every
 * database twice an hour — so a workspace nobody had visited in weeks cost the
 * same as one in daily use. In a pooled fleet, where most trials go quiet after
 * signup, that idle majority is most of the primary's connection churn and hot
 * page cache.
 *
 * ## The rule
 *
 * A workspace is **dormant** when no HTTP request has reached it for
 * `config.workspaceDormantAfterHours` (default seven days). Dormant workspaces
 * get no job loop and are skipped by fleet passes. The next request wakes them:
 * the request path stamps `cp_workspace_activity`, the worker's next refresh
 * (≤ 60s) sees the stamp and starts the loop again.
 *
 * Idle is decided by *requests*, not by pool usage, because the worker's own
 * loop keeps a pool warm — measuring that would keep every workspace awake
 * forever. Health probes never reach the request hook (`request-scope.ts`
 * `FLEET_PATHS`), so the platform's probing cannot wake anything either.
 *
 * Not every request counts. A wildcard domain is crawled continuously —
 * `GET /.env` scanners, anonymous `GET /` — and that traffic reaches parked
 * workspaces within minutes, so "any request" would re-wake the whole fleet in
 * days. A request is evidence of use (`isActivitySignal`) when it is a mutation, or
 * when it carries a session cookie or bearer token. An anonymous GET is not;
 * the portal still serves it (the request path is untouched), and if the
 * visitor then posts or votes, that POST wakes the loop within a minute — the
 * job it enqueues waits at most that long, which is the existing loop cadence.
 *
 * ## What idleness is not allowed to skip
 *
 * "Nobody visited" is not the same as "nothing to do". A workspace can be idle
 * with a delayed job in its queue (a hook retry, a scheduled publish) or a
 * clock-driven deadline (a snoozed conversation, an SLA due-at). Those are the
 * two things the database already knows how to report — `earliestPendingJobAt`
 * and `earliestWorkspaceDeadline` — so the worker asks both before it parks a
 * loop, and keeps the loop for any workspace that answers. That check needs the
 * workspace's own database, so it lives in the worker (`worker.ts`), and the
 * result is published here (`hasStandingWork`) so a fleet pass in the same
 * process honours the same exception.
 *
 * ## Where the stamp lives
 *
 * `cp_workspace_activity` is a control-plane table (CP migration 0089) written
 * by this app from the request path, on the same footing as
 * `cp_workspace_schema_state`. It has to be shared storage rather than process
 * memory: the web replica sees the requests and the worker replica owns the
 * loops. Writes are throttled to one per workspace per `STAMP_INTERVAL_MS`, so
 * a busy workspace costs one tiny control-plane UPDATE every five minutes and a
 * quiet one costs nothing.
