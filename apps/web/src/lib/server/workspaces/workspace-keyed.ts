/**
 * Making process-lifetime caches workspace-safe.
 *
 * SAAS-HOSTING-STACK.md §4 counts ~20 module-scope caches that are correct for
 * one process serving one workspace and become cross-workspace capabilities the moment
 * one process serves several: a magic-link stash keyed only by lowercased email,
 * an S3 client built from global config, HKDF keys keyed by purpose alone, a
 * daily visitor-hash salt, a built better-auth instance.
 *
 * The fix is always the same shape, so it lives here once: prefix the key with
 * the active workspace. Two helpers, and the choice between them is not stylistic.
 *
 * - {@link workspaceScopedKey} is for keys that leave the process — Redis keys, channel
 *   names, lock names. Those must be *namespaced*, and the namespace has to be
 *   stable and greppable because it also has to be reasoned about during an
 *   incident.
 * - {@link WorkspaceKeyedCache} is for in-heap maps. It also bounds itself, which
 *   the raw `Map`s it replaces do not: an unbounded per-workspace map in a pooled
 *   process is a slow leak with a workspace-count multiplier.
 *
 * ## The single-workspace identity
 *
 * With no workspace scope the prefix is `_` — one stable namespace, not a random
 * or absent one. That keeps self-hosted behaviour byte-identical (every key
 * lands in the same namespace it always did, modulo the constant prefix) and
 * keeps the pooled and single code paths the same code rather than two branches
 * that can drift.
 *
 * ## What this does NOT do
 *
 * It does not make a cache *correct*; it makes it *separated*. A cache holding
 * something that must not outlive a request still needs a request-scoped home
 * (`request-memo.ts`), and a cache holding a secret still needs
 * the secret resolved per workspace. Prefixing a key that was already wrong just
 * makes it wrong per workspace.

 * a human during an incident, and "which workspace is this" must not require
 * knowing the id format.
 *
 * The marker moved from `t:` with the workspace remodel, which abandons any key
 * an older process left behind. Safe because it is affordable, not because it
 * is invisible: everything reachable through this helper is a cache, a
