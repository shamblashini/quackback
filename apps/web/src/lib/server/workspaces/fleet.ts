/**
 * Running background work for every workspace.
 *
 * SAAS-HOSTING-STACK.md §5, caveat 3: roughly 25–35 files across ~15 background
 * subsystems run with no request scope at all — sweeps, queues,
 * migrations, CLI backfills, the readiness probe. Each needs a workspace scope, and
 * each needs a per-subsystem answer to one question: *iterate all workspaces per
 * tick, or give each workspace its own schedule?*
 *
 * This module is the "iterate all workspaces per tick" answer, which is the right
 * one for everything already shaped as a periodic sweep. Per-workspace scheduling
 * is a Postgres-queue concern and belongs with the lease primitive, not here.
 *
 * Two properties are deliberate.
 *
 * **Single-workspace behaviour is untouched.** Under `QUACKBACK_TENANCY=single`
 * `runFleetPass` calls the body exactly once, with no scope, exactly as the
 * sweeper does today. Self-hosted installs get no new machinery and no new
 * failure modes.
 *
 * **One workspace's failure never ends the pass.** A sweep that aborted the fleet
 * because workspace 7 of 400 had a refused fingerprint would turn a single bad
 * record into a fleet-wide outage of every sweeper. Failures are counted,
 * logged with their workspace, and the pass continues — which is the same choice
 * `listActiveWorkspaces` makes when it drops refused records rather than throwing.
