/**
 * The active workspace, carried on the request-scoped AsyncLocalStorage store.
 *
 * SAAS-HOSTING-STACK.md §6: workspace resolution happens once, from the Host
 * header, before auth runs — auth is itself full of `db` queries, so a workspace
 * decided "once auth resolves" is decided far too late to route the database.
 *
 * The store already exists. `middleware/request-context.ts` opens a
 * `runWithLogContext` object at the very start of every SSR document, server
 * route and server function, and `request-memo.ts` already
 * demonstrates hanging request-scoped state off it under a symbol key. This is
 * the same mechanism, one field wider.
 *
 * Two properties matter and both are load-bearing:
 *
 * 1. **Synchronous read.** `db.ts`'s Proxy trap is synchronous, so the resolved
 *    Drizzle handle has to already be sitting in the store by the time any call
 *    site touches `db`. Acquisition is async and happens in the middleware;
 *    everything downstream just reads.
 * 2. **Absence is an error, not a default.** Under pooled workspaces there is no
 *    fleet-wide database to fall back to, and a fallback is exactly how §3's
 *    failure mode — serving another workspace's data while every permission check
 *    passes — would come back.
