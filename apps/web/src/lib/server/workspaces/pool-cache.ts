/**
 * The workspace-keyed connection-pool cache (SAAS-HOSTING-STACK.md §6).
 *
 * One process, many workspaces, one database each. This is the LRU that turns
 * a resolved workspace record into a live `postgres.js` pool, and it is where the
 * §3 fingerprint assertion is enforced — once per pool, not once per request.
 *
 * ## Eviction is the cost model, not memory hygiene
 *
 * The fleet suspends a compute when **no client is connected**. An open pool holds
 * the database awake, so eviction is the single thing that makes an idle workspace
 * cost storage only instead of running compute indefinitely. The
 * same silence is what lets a Railway `role=web` service sleep, since Railway's
 * rule triggers on ten minutes without an *outbound* packet.
 *
 * So `workspacePoolIdleSeconds` must sit comfortably below **both** the
 * database `suspend_timeout_seconds` (300s by default) and Railway's 600s window. Get it
 * wrong and every workspace ever routed to an instance stays awake forever —
 * silently, with no functional signal that the cost model has stopped working.
 * That is why `poolsEvicted` is a first-class counter here rather than a debug
 * log: it is the only observable that distinguishes "working" from "quietly
 * costing money".
 *
 * Request-path pools still evict after `workspacePoolIdleSeconds`. The job
 * worker holds its own per-workspace connections for as long as the loop runs.
 *
 * ## Credential rotation
 *
 * The record carries `dbRole` as a field precisely because passwords rotate
 * underneath a live pool. `postgres.js` accepts a *function* for `password` and
 * calls it on every new connection, so rotation is handled by re-resolving
 * rather than by wedging: an existing socket keeps working, and the next one
 * picks up the new password. A pool whose credential is revoked outright fails
 * its next connection, is evicted, and is rebuilt on the following request.
