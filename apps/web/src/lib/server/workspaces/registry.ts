/**
 * Reading the workspace registry — the app side of `quackback-cp`'s
 * `docs/workspace-registry-contract.md`.
 *
 * The control plane owns two tables in its own Postgres:
 * `cp_workspace_hostnames` (hostname → workspace, hostname is the primary key, so
 * fleet-wide uniqueness is structural) and `cp_workspace_registry` (one row per
 * workspace, carrying everything needed to serve it). This module turns a Host
 * header into one of five outcomes, and only one of them carries a DSN.
 *
 * Three things are deliberate.
 *
 * **One query, not two.** A separate hostname lookup would open a window in
 * which the record and its hostnames disagree, and this runs on every cache
 * miss on the request path.
 *
 * **Validation is the vendored contract, not a local reading.** `validateWorkspaceRecord`
 * comes from `vendor/contract.ts`, copied byte-for-byte from the control plane
 * so the two repos cannot drift into two readings of the same record. A reader
 * that trusts the writer is one migration away from serving the wrong workspace.
 *
 * **Catalog identity (`pg_database_oid` / `pg_cluster_id` / `db_name`) is read
 * here even though contract v1 does not carry it in `WorkspaceRecord`.** Those
 * columns are the anti-clone half of the fingerprint — see
 * `physical-identity.ts`. They are attached alongside the validated record
 * rather than smuggled into it, so the vendored schema stays byte-identical to
 * the control plane's.

 * a workspace pool.
 *
 * ## It releases between reads, and that is a decision with a cost
 *
 * This connection used to be held open on the grounds that a control database is
 * always warm anyway. Measured, "always warm" meant **95% active for 23 hours**
 * — a compute billed continuously so that a cache miss could save a connect. It
 * is not exempt from the cost model just because it is not per workspace, so
 * `idle_timeout` now lets the socket go and the compute suspend.
 *
 * The cost, stated rather than discovered: the registry read happens on a cache
 * miss *before* the workspace connection is opened, so the first request to a
 * fleet that has been idle long enough for both computes to suspend pays a
 * control wake and then a workspace wake, **in series**. Two cold starts, not one.
 *
 * What keeps that off the common path is that the control database is shared.
 * Every hostname's miss lands on it, so it stays warm while *any* workspace in the
 * fleet is being served; it can only suspend after the entire fleet has been
 * silent. The serial double wake is therefore the first request to the whole
 * fleet after fleet-wide idleness, which is the one moment nobody is waiting.
 * The `Sql` object itself is kept — `postgres.js` holds no socket while idle, so
 * the singleton is a handle rather than a connection, and dropping it would only
 * mean rebuilding the pool object.
