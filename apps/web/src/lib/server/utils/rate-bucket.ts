/**
 * Postgres-backed fixed-window rate-limit primitive.
 *
 * Successor to `utils/redis-rate-bucket.ts`. One
 * `INSERT … ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE` per check, which is the honest cost of the
 * change: a database round trip where Redis served a sub-millisecond INCR, on
 * the sign-in and widget hot paths. The measurement is in `KV.md`.
 *
 * The contract the callers rely on is unchanged, including the failure
 * direction: **fails OPEN** (returns a `null` count) so a store outage does not
 * lock every caller out of sign-in. Nothing here decides policy — the
 * per-endpoint limits live in `auth/signin-rate-limit.ts`,
 * `auth/widget-rate-limit.ts`, `domains/api/rate-limit.ts` and their siblings.
 *
 * ## The workspace is in the key, and that is load-bearing
 *
 * Bucket names are built from identifiers that only mean something inside one
 * workspace — a principal id, an email, an IP paired with an action. Left
 * undiscriminated, one workspace's traffic spends another's budget: a denial of
 * service that needs no credentials. `pg-kv.ts` writes
 * `rate_bucket.workspace_key` from the same `currentWorkspaceNamespace()` that built
 * the Redis `t:<workspaceKey>:` prefix, and every read filters on it. Under pooled
 * tenancy the row is additionally in the workspace's own database.
