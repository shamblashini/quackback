/**
 * Which bundled migrations may be **replayed** against a database that already
 * carries their effects.
 *
 * This exists because of something the fleet actually did, not a hypothetical.
 * Five live workspace databases have a complete 226-row `drizzle.__drizzle_migrations`
 * that stops at `0248`, while physically carrying assorted later migrations —
 * because every one of them was applied with raw `psql -f`, which never writes
 * the ledger. Running a migrator against them replays whatever the ledger does
 * not record.
 *
 * There are two wrong answers to that and one right one.
 *
 * - **Wrong: invent the ledger rows.** A row asserting a migration ran when
 *   nobody watched it run is worse than a missing row, because a missing row
 *   is a question and a wrong row is a false answer. The standing judgement in
 *   this work is exactly that.
 * - **Wrong: refuse anything that is not idempotent.** 197 of the 228 bundled
 *   migrations are plain `CREATE TABLE` / `ADD COLUMN`, so that rule would
 *   refuse every ordinary rollout as well as every fresh workspace, whose replay
 *   set is the entire lineage starting at `0000_initial`.
 * - **Right: separate the two ways a replay can go wrong, because only one of
 *   them is dangerous.** A replay that *errors* is caught by the fact that
 *   `migrate()` wraps the whole lineage in one transaction — the run rolls back
 *   whole and Postgres's own message ("column ... already exists") is the
 *   ledger-drift diagnosis, produced by the database rather than predicted. A
 *   replay that *succeeds and writes* is the one atomicity cannot save you
 *   from, and it is the only class this gates on.
 *
 * Then the ledger row that gets written is written by drizzle *after it actually
 * executed the statements*, which is evidence rather than assertion. Nothing
 * here ever inserts a ledger row itself.
 *
 * ## What makes a statement replay-safe
 *
 * Only that **running it a second time against a database where it already ran
 * changes nothing**. That is a narrower claim than "idempotent" in general and
 * it is checkable syntactically for the shapes this repository uses:
 *
 * | Safe | Because |
 * | --- | --- |
 * | `CREATE … IF NOT EXISTS` | skipped when present |
 * | `DROP … IF EXISTS` | skipped when absent |
 * | `ALTER TABLE … ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS` | skipped when present |
 * | `CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION/VIEW/TRIGGER` | overwritten with the same text |
 * | `COMMENT ON …` | overwritten with the same text |
 * | `INSERT … ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING/UPDATE` | absorbed |
 * | `SET`/`SELECT` with no write | no effect |
 *
 * `stripNoise` is reused from the destructive-DDL scanner rather than
 * re-tokenised, so the two agree about what is a comment and what is a string —
 * and so the dollar-quoted-literal limitation documented there is one
 * limitation rather than two.
 *
 * ## The one thing a human may assert that this cannot see
 *
 * A `DO $$ … $$` block is opaque here and is refused (`mutates`) for that
 * reason. That is the right default, and teaching this file to parse plpgsql
 * would be the wrong fix: the sibling scanner already carries one recall hole
 * around dollar-quoted text, and a deeper parser would deepen it rather than
 * close it.
 *
 * So the escape is not a smarter parser, it is an **explicit claim a reviewer
 * signs**, in the same shape as the destructive-DDL linter's
 * `-- @contract: safe-after X.Y.Z`:
 *
 * ```sql
 * -- @replay: guarded-by the old column still existing; the rename is skipped once it is gone
 * DO $$ BEGIN IF EXISTS (…) THEN ALTER TABLE … RENAME COLUMN … ; END IF; END $$;
 * ```
 *
 * Three properties are what make it a claim rather than a loophole:
 *
 * 1. **It only reaches a `DO` block.** Put it above an `INSERT`, an `UPDATE` or
 *    anything else in `MUTATING_SHAPES` and the file is refused *and* the
 *    misplacement is reported. The annotation can never launder a write this
 *    file can actually read.
 * 2. **It is scoped to one statement**, not to the file — it must sit in the
 *    comment block directly above the statement it vouches for. `@contract` is
 *    file-scoped because its subject (a release) genuinely is; this one's
 *    subject is a guard, and a guard is a property of a single statement.
 * 3. **It is checked, not trusted.** `__tests__/lineage-double-apply.db.test.ts`
 *    re-applies every migration this file calls `safe` to an already-migrated
 *    database and asserts the catalogue does not move. A wrong annotation turns
 *    that test red; nothing about writing the comment makes the claim true.
 *
 * Anything malformed, dangling, or attached to the wrong kind of statement is
 * reported as mutating. The failure direction is always "refuse the replay".
 *
 * ## The thing this file reads that it cannot see
 *
 * Everything above judges one migration against the schema **that file**
 * expects. A replay happens against the schema the **whole lineage** produced,
 * and those differ whenever a later migration moves the object an earlier one
 * names. `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS x` is `safe` in isolation and drops a live table
 * once a later migration has put `x` back; `CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS … ON y`
 * is `safe` in isolation and has no relation to build on once a later migration
 * has dropped `y`.
 *
 * Closing that properly means teaching this file object lifetimes across the
 * whole corpus. Until someone does, the individual known-wrong verdicts are
 * corrected by name in {@link REPLAY_OVERRIDES} — see its own comment for why
 * that lives here rather than in each caller.

/**
 * What a second run of this migration does to a database where it already ran.
 *
 * The three-way split is the whole point, and a two-way one would be useless:
 *
 * - `safe` — changes nothing. Replaying is free.
 * - `errors` — the statement fails ("column already exists", "relation already
 *   exists"). **This is not dangerous**, because `migrate()` wraps the entire
 *   lineage in one transaction, so the run rolls back whole and the database's
 *   own error message *is* the ledger-drift diagnosis. Nearly every historical
 *   migration is this, which is why a gate that refused them would refuse every
 *   ordinary rollout.
 * - `mutates` — the statement **succeeds and changes data**: an `INSERT` with no
 *   `ON CONFLICT`, an `UPDATE`, a `DELETE`, a `DO` block that could contain
 *   anything. This is the only genuinely dangerous class, because atomicity
 *   cannot save you from a replay that works.
 *
 * So the reconciler gates on `mutates` alone, and mis-classifying something
 * *into* `errors` costs nothing while mis-classifying something *out of*
 * `mutates` is the real error. The `mutates` detector is deliberately greedy for
 * that reason.

/**
 * A verdict a reviewer has corrected by hand, because the shape reading above
 * is right about the file and wrong about the lineage.
 *
 * ### Why this is here and not in the callers
 *
 * It was in a test. `__tests__/lineage-double-apply.db.test.ts` measured both of
 * the entries below by applying the whole lineage twice, wrote them down, and
 * skipped them — so the only code that knew these two verdicts were false was
 * the code that had no way to act on them. `gapHealVerdict` in the fleet
 * migrator, which truncates a live workspace's ledger on the strength of a `safe`
 * verdict, did not know they existed. Correcting the verdict at its source is
 * what makes the heal, the replay gate and the CLI preflight all right at once,
 * instead of three lists that can drift apart.
 *
 * ### The three properties that keep this from becoming an exemption list
 *
 * 1. **It can only ever refuse.** `verdict` excludes `safe` in the type, and the
 *    override is applied by taking the *worse* of the two verdicts, so an entry
 *    can raise `safe` to `mutates` and can never lower anything. An override
 *    that waves a replay through is not merely discouraged, it is unwritable.
 * 2. **Each entry says why in a form a reviewer can check** — which later
 *    migration falsifies the shape reading, and what the replay does instead.
 *    Not a tag and a shrug.
 * 3. **Each entry is re-earned on every run of the double-apply test.** Deleting
 *    one puts its migration back in that test's replay-safe set, where it is
 *    re-applied against a fully migrated database and fails — named, with the
 *    error. So an entry cannot be dropped to make something green; it can only
 *    be dropped once the replay genuinely stops failing, which is the same
 *    evidence that put it here. `stillFailsWith` is what that test matches, so
 *    the entry carries its own falsification condition.
