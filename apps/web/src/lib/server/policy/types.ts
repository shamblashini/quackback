 * Central policy types.

 * Every policy module exposes two complementary functions per resource:
 *   - canX(actor, resource): Decision      — single-row authorization
 *   - xFilter(actor): SQL predicate         — list-query authorization
 *
 * Decisions are an explicit discriminated union so the deny case
 * always carries a machine-readable reason for logging and UI hints.
