/**
 * Transactional test-DB fixture: real Postgres, zero persistence. Every test
 * runs inside a transaction that is ALWAYS rolled back (begin in beforeEach,
 * sentinel-throw rollback in afterEach). Usage, the importOriginal-spread
 * rebind of the global `db`, and the policy on when to mock instead all live
 * in README.md next to this file.
 *
 * Mechanics unique to this file:
 * - The transaction callback parks on a hold promise so one transaction
 *   spans the whole test; rollback releases it and the sentinel throw makes
 *   ROLLBACK the only exit, even on test failure.
 * - `testDb` is a proxy onto the live transaction handle, shaped like the
 *   global `db`. Code under test calling `db.transaction(...)` gets a
 *   savepoint inside the fixture's transaction, so even a committed inner
 *   transaction vanishes at rollback.
 * - The module-level transaction slot is file-scoped (vitest isolates module
 *   registries per file); each file opens its own connection, and tests
 *   within a file must run sequentially (no `it.concurrent`).
