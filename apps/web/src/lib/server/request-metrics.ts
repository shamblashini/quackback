/**
 * Per-request work counters.
 *
 * Counts are deterministic where wall-clock time is not: the same page against
 * the same data runs the same number of queries on every run, so a count can
 * be compared against a checked-in ceiling and fail CI on one run. The access
 * log carries them as field data, and the Server-Timing header (opt-in) shows
 * them in the browser's network panel.
 *
 * The counters hang off the request's log context under a symbol key, like the
 * auth memo in `request-memo.ts`. Symbol keys survive the
 * `{ ...parent }` copy a workspace scope makes, so a child scope keeps counting
 * into the same object, and the logger's JSON output never includes them.
