/**
 * One-time relocation of objects stored before the workspace namespace.
 *
 * Every object name is composed as `w/<workspace TypeID>/<stored key>` (see
 * `namespace.ts`), and there is deliberately no read fallback to the bare key
 * (see the header of `s3.ts`). An install that served files before that layout
 * therefore holds them where nothing reads any more. On a single-workspace
 * install the bucket holds exactly one workspace, so the bare keys are
 * unambiguously its own, and this copies each one to its namespaced name.
 *
 * - **Copy, never move.** The originals stay, so a database backup taken before
 *   the upgrade still finds every file after a restore to the older build.
 * - **Server-side.** CopyObject inside the bucket; no bytes pass through here,
 *   and Content-Type and user metadata are copied with the object.
 * - **Idempotent.** A destination that already holds the same object is
 *   skipped, so an interrupted run resumes by simply running again.
 * - **Never clobbers.** A destination that holds a *different* object was
 *   written under the namespace by the running build and wins; it is counted
 *   and logged, never overwritten. Each copy re-checks its destination and is
 *   conditional (`If-None-Match: *`) where the provider honours that; the
 *   residual window on providers that ignore it is described at the copy.
 * - **Once, after a grace period.** The first complete pass is recorded in
 *   `kv_store` with its counts. During a rolling upgrade a replica of the
 *   older build can keep writing bare keys after that pass, so cheap
 *   reconciling passes (identical destinations are skipped) continue hourly
 *   until {@link RECONCILE_GRACE_MS} after it, and only then is the marker
 *   final. A pass with any failed copy records nothing, so the next attempt
 *   retries.
 *
 * Never runs under pooled tenancy: there the bucket is shared and a bare key is
 * nobody's. `openLegacyRelocationBucket()` refuses that independently.
