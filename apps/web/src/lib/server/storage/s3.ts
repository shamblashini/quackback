/**
 * S3-Compatible Storage Client
 *
 * Provides a unified interface for uploading files to S3-compatible storage services:
 * - AWS S3
 * - Cloudflare R2
 * - Backblaze B2
 * - MinIO (for local development)
 *
 * Note: AWS SDK imports are dynamic to avoid build issues when packages aren't installed.
 *
 * Type safety: TypeScript with moduleResolution "bundler" cannot fully resolve
 * the AWS SDK v3 barrel exports (deep re-export chains through commands/ and
 * @smithy/smithy-client are only partially resolved). We define structural
 * interfaces for the exact SDK surface we use, with `as unknown as S3Module`
 * applied at the two dynamic import boundaries. All downstream code is fully
 * typed with no `any`.
 *
 * ## Every object name is composed for one workspace
 *
 * Nothing below addresses the bucket directly. {@link currentWorkspaceStorage}
 * returns the only thing that can issue a command; its methods take the *stored*
 * key and compose `w/<selfReportedWorkspaceId>/` internally. It is the only export that
 * yields a client, and the factory behind it is deliberately private — see
 * `workspace-scope.ts` for the hole that was, and `namespace.ts` for why the
 * identifier is `settings.id` and not something else.
 *
 * The exported helpers (`uploadObject`, `getS3Object`, `deleteObject`, the two
 * presigners) keep the signatures ~20 call sites already use and resolve the
 * workspace themselves. Threading a workspace id through those call sites is the
 * convention this design exists to replace: a convention survives until the next
 * call site is added by someone who has not read this file.
 *
 * ## Relocating objects that predate the namespace
 *
 * An install that served files before the namespace holds its objects at bare
 * keys, and composing a namespace makes them unreachable. There is deliberately
 * **no read-time fallback to the bare key.** Under one fleet bucket a bare key
 * is nobody's namespace, so reading it is the §3 failure exactly; and any
 * "…except when the bucket is not shared" carve-out would have to be gated on a
 * configuration value, which is the class of thing nobody checks and everybody
 * eventually gets wrong. The fallback is not merely unsafe by default, it is
 * unsafe in a way nothing in this process can detect.
 *
 * The relocation is instead a one-time copy inside the bucket, and on a
 * single-workspace install it runs by itself: `legacy-relocation.ts`, armed by
 * `startup.ts` on the process that runs background work, copies every key
 * outside any workspace namespace (a stored key may itself start with `w/`;
 * only `w/<valid workspace TypeID>/` is a namespace) to
 * `w/<workspace TypeID>/<key>` with server-side CopyObject, keeps the originals (so a restored older database backup still finds its
 * files), skips destinations already present, and records completion in
 * `kv_store`. Until its first pass finishes, pre-existing assets 404; it runs
 * in the background so readiness never waits on it, and keeps reconciling
 * hourly for a day afterwards so bare keys an older replica writes during a
 * rolling upgrade are picked up too.
 *
 * Links to those objects were minted before read tokens and carry none. On a
 * single-workspace install the storage route still serves such a link while
 * the bare original remains, reading the relocated copy; see
 * {@link isPreNamespaceObject}.
 *
 * It reaches the bucket root through {@link openLegacyRelocationBucket}, which
 * refuses under pooled tenancy and inside any workspace scope. Listing and
 * copying at the root is correct against a bucket that holds one workspace and
 * catastrophic against one that holds the fleet, so that capability exists for
 * this one job, only where the bucket provably holds one workspace, and it has
 * no delete.
 *
 * For anything the automatic copy does not cover (pooled tenancy, a bulk move
 * between buckets, or an object over CopyObject's 5 GB single-request limit,
 * which the application never writes), the operator fallback is:
 *
 * ```
 * aws s3 cp s3://<bucket>/ s3://<bucket>/w/<workspace TypeID>/ --recursive --exclude 'w/workspace_*'
 * ```
 *
 * (`mv` instead of `cp` to drop the originals.) The prefix is
 * `fromUuid('workspace', settings.id)` (for example
 * `workspace_01kxddf1jaf6cr22gerxt7z9gg`). `SELECT id FROM settings` returns
 * the UUID spelling; copying under that UUID leaves every restored object
 * unreadable. Convert the UUID before composing `w/<prefix>/`.
 *
 * Either way it is a server-side copy: no bytes leave the bucket, the stored
 * keys do not change, and no content is rewritten, because the namespace
 * appears in neither the database nor any URL.

 * reach the fleet bucket with the fleet credential. The refusal that makes an

 *
 * A guard cannot repair that, because "no scope" is a legitimate state: it is

 * relocation (`legacy-relocation.ts`) copies such an object to its namespaced
 * name and keeps the bare original, and nothing written since creates a bare
 * key, so "the bare original exists" is exactly "this object predates the
 * namespace". A new upload never has one and keeps needing its token.
 *
 * The bare original is only ever asked about, never served: the route still
 * reads the namespaced copy. That keeps the header's rule that reads never
 * fall back to a bare key, and it is why this is safe to answer from a HEAD.
 *
 * Narrowed on purpose:
 * - **Single-workspace only.** Under pooled tenancy, or inside any workspace
 *   scope, a bucket-root key is nobody's namespace, so the answer is no without
 *   asking.
 * - **Pre-token private prefixes only** ({@link PRE_TOKEN_PRIVATE_PREFIXES}).
 *   A key under `w/<workspace>/` is therefore never asked about, so no other
 *   namespace's object, nor this workspace's own new upload, can stand in for
 *   a bare original.
 * - **Canonical keys only.** The key must compose into this workspace's
 *   namespace, which refuses traversal, encoded traversal, empty and relative
 *   segments and backslashes, so no spelling of a key borrows another
 *   object's existence.
 *
 * Answers are cached, and only a key with no fresh answer costs a HEAD.
 * `mayAskBucket` gates that request: the route passes a per-client budget, so
 * token-less requests for made-up keys cannot turn into unbounded calls to the
 * object store. Refused, the answer is no, which is the ordinary 403.
 *
 * An operator who moved rather than copied the originals has no bare key left,
 * and those links then need their token like any other private link.
