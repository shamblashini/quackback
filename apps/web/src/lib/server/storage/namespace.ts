/**
 * Composing a bucket object name for one workspace, then proving it landed
 * inside that workspace.
 *
 * SAAS-HOSTING-STACK.md §9 replaces one bucket per workspace with one bucket for
 * the fleet and a per-workspace key prefix. That moves the isolation boundary out
 * of the provider and into this file. A per-bucket credential could not name
 * another workspace's bucket whatever the application believed; a shared bucket has
 * no such backstop, so the failure shape is §3's exactly: **a key that escapes
 * its namespace reads another customer's object, and it does not error and it
 * looks correct.**
 *
 * ## Why the WorkspaceId, and not some other identifier
 *
 * The namespace is `settings.id` — the branded {@link WorkspaceId}. It is not a
 * new workspace identifier, and refusing to invent one is the point: it is the
 * value §3's fingerprint already asserts. `evaluateWorkspaceIdentity` refuses a
 * pool whose `settings.id` is not the one the registry named, so **a database
 * that passes the fingerprint has, by construction, the right storage
 * namespace.**
 *
 * That inheritance is the whole argument, because there is no storage-side
 * fingerprint and there cannot be: a database can be asked who it is, an object
 * under the wrong prefix reads back perfectly and has nothing to say. Storage
 * therefore borrows the database's verification instead of holding one of its
 * own, and any identifier that did not come from that check — a slug, a
 * hostname, a request parameter, a segment of a stored key — forfeits the
 * inheritance silently.
 *
 * ## The stored key never carries the namespace
 *
 * `generateStorageKey()` keeps producing `uploads/2026/08/…`, the database keeps
 * storing exactly that, and `w/<workspaceId>/` is added here and stripped
 * nowhere else. Two properties depend on it. `isPublicStorageKey` still
 * classifies on segment 0 of the *stored* key, so prefixing does not turn every
 * public asset private. And `contentJson` stores host-independent
 * `/api/storage/${key}` refs, which stay valid across a friendly URL rename
 * and make any future move of the objects a copy rather than a content rewrite.
 *
 * ## Compose, then verify
 *
 * {@link composeNamespacedKey} is the only door, and it asserts on the *result*
 * rather than on the input. Verifying the composed name is what makes one check
 * cover traversal, absolute keys, empty keys and encoding tricks at once: they
 * are all the same claim — "the name that is about to reach a command is not
 * inside the namespace it was composed for" — and asking that question of the
 * finished string cannot miss a way of arriving at it. A composed name that
 * fails throws. It never falls back to the un-namespaced key, because in a
 * shared bucket that key is nobody's namespace.
