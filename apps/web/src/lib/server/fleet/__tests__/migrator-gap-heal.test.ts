/**
 * Healing a ledger with a hole in it, against a real Postgres.
 *
 * `migrator-gate.test.ts` decides *whether* a hole may be closed; nothing pure
 * can establish that closing it works, because the claim is about what Drizzle's
 * migrator does with a `drizzle.__drizzle_migrations` table it did not expect —
 * and that is a property of the driver and of these 234 SQL files, not of our
 * arithmetic about them.
 *
 * The state under test is one that happened. Two live workspaces had a high-water
 * mark at `0253` with rows absent for `0249`, `0250`, `0252`, `0256` and `0257`,
 * `settings.cloud` physically missing, and every page returning 500 — while the
 * reconciler reported `OK [reconciled] post=true` and the post-condition check
 * reported `ok=true`. Both instruments agreed the workspace was fine. The fixtures
 * below reproduce that ledger exactly and assert that neither instrument says so
 * any more.
 *
 * The fixtures withhold every migration this branch adds above the healable
 * window as well.
 * The measured shape is a high-water mark at `0253` with a forward tail above
 * it; a newer migration whose row a fixture kept would push the mark past that
 * tail, folding the tail into the hole and quietly substituting a different
 * shape that still parses.
 *
 * ## Method
 *
 * - **Every test gets its own database**, copied from one fully migrated
 *   template. Nothing here touches the shared `quackback_test`, and no assertion
 *   counts rows it does not own.
 * - **`migrateWorkspace` is the subject, not a re-implementation of it.** The only
 *   seam is the workspace's password: `withPassword` is a pure string function, so
 *   a descriptor pointing at the scratch database and a stubbed password
 *   resolver put the real function on a real database with its real gates.
 * - **"Unchanged" is only ever asserted about quiescent things.** The catalogue
 *   digest reads `information_schema.columns` and `pg_index`, and the ledger
 *   check reads `drizzle.__drizzle_migrations` — none of which any tier writes
 *   in the background. Row counts of `job_queue` or the kv tables could not
 *   answer "did anything change" on a live workspace, so they are not used to
 *   answer it here either.
