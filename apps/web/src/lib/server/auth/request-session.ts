/**
 * The current request's identity, resolved once.
 *
 * Several independent paths ask who the caller is during one request: the
 * bootstrap payload, the portal-access gate, the auth helpers behind every
 * server function and the session helper the rest of them use. They all ask
 * here, and this runs the Better Auth session lookup and the principal read at
 * most once per request.
 *
 * Every read is memoized for the current request only (`request-memo.ts`),
 * partitioned by workspace, and taken from the request's own headers, so
 * nothing crosses a request, a user or a workspace. Cookie and Bearer
 * credentials resolve exactly as a direct `auth.api.getSession` call would, and
 * the session's `scope` still says which audience it belongs to.
 *
 * What the memo holds is the identity as the request first saw it. A write
 * that changes it, followed by a read in the same request, forgets it in
 * between, and the two ways that happen are already wired:
 *
 * - every in-process Better Auth endpoint other than `/get-session` (sign-in,
 *   sign-out, password and email changes, session revocation, account
 *   linking) forgets the whole identity from the after-hook in `hooks.ts`;
 * - deleting a principal's cache key forgets that principal (`cacheDel` in
 *   `cache.ts`), and every role and type mutation already deletes it.
 *
 * Better Auth may write while resolving a session (sliding the expiry past
 * `updateAge`, clearing a stale cookie). Those writes happen on the first
 * resolution, whose Set-Cookie headers reach the response exactly as before; a
 * repeat lookup in the same request would have found nothing left to do.
