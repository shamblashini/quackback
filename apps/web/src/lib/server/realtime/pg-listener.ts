/**
 * The realtime bus's receive side — `LISTEN quackback_realtime` on a
 * session-mode connection.
 *
 * The discipline is the same one the job queue used to take, and the reason is the same
 * measurement: through a transaction-mode pooler a notify **never
 * arrives, at any concurrency — including a single client**, while
 * `pg_listening_channels()` reports the registration as held the whole time
 * (SAAS-HOSTING-STACK.md §7.3, measured 2026-08-08). So:
 *
 * 1. The connection is built from the workspace's **direct** DSN, never from the
 *    pool cache.
 * 2. A listener is only ever verified by round-tripping a real NOTIFY.
 *    `verify()` sends one from a *separate* connection and waits for it —
 *    nothing here asks the catalogue whether it is registered, and nothing
 *    should.
 *
 * ## One channel, not one per topic
 *
 * `pg_notify`'s channel is an identifier, capped at 63 bytes, and a logical
 * channel like `conversation:<uuid>` under a workspace prefix does not fit. So
 * every workspace database uses ONE channel and carries the logical channel inside
 * the payload. That also means one LISTEN per connection rather than one per
 * SSE stream, which is what keeps the connection count proportional to *workspaces
 * with live streams on this replica* rather than to streams.
 *
 * ## What this costs, stated plainly
 *
 * §7.3's warning is that a pooled process holding N permanent session
 * connections purely to receive notifies inverts the reason for pooling. That
 * warning applies to a process that listens for *every* workspace. This one opens
 * a connection when a workspace's first SSE stream arrives on this replica and
 * closes it when the last one leaves, so the bound is the number of workspaces
 * currently holding an SSE stream here — a resource that is already long-lived
 * and already proportional to the same thing.
