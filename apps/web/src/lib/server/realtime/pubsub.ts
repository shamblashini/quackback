/**
 * Real-time fan-out bus for conversations, on Postgres `LISTEN`/`NOTIFY`
 * (SAAS-HOSTING-STACK.md §7.4).
 *
 * Postgres is the durable source of truth; this layer is fire-and-forget
 * delivery only. A message written on one app replica must reach an SSE
 * connection pinned to another replica. Redis pub/sub did that; `pg_notify`
 * does it now, from the workspace's own database.
 *
 * ## Three differences from the Redis version, all deliberate
 *
 * **One wire channel per database, logical channels inside the payload.**
 * A NOTIFY channel is an identifier capped at 63 bytes, and
 * `conversation:<uuid>` under a workspace prefix does not fit. So every message
 * travels on `quackback_realtime` and names its logical channel in the
 * envelope. Every subscriber on a replica sees its own workspace's whole realtime
 * stream and filters in process — which is what the previous in-process
 * listener registry already did, one level down.
 *
 * **Oversized payloads spill to a row.** `pg_notify` caps a payload at 8000
 * bytes; Redis PUBLISH had no such limit, and a conversation event carrying a
 * long message body can exceed it. Dropping the event would be a message the
 * agent never sees, so it is written to `realtime_overflow` and the NOTIFY
 * carries the row id. Steady state on a normal install is zero rows.
 *
 * **The subscriber connection is direct, and per workspace.** `LISTEN` through a
 * transaction-mode pooler registers and never delivers (§7.3, measured). See
 * `pg-listener.ts` for the connection, and for why it is verified by a real
 * notify round trip rather than by reading `pg_listening_channels()`.
 *
 * ## Workspace isolation
 *
 * Stated three times, on purpose. The in-process registry is keyed by
 * `(workspace namespace, logical channel)`; each workspace's messages arrive on that
 * workspace's own connection to that workspace's own database; and every envelope
 * names its publishing workspace, which `dispatch` refuses if it disagrees with the
 * connection.
 *
 * The third one is not decoration. Without it the whole property rested on the
 * database boundary, and `pubsub.db.test.ts` proved that is not enough: two
 * scopes on one database delivered one workspace's inbox events to the other's
 * subscriber. That configuration is not supposed to exist, which is exactly why
 * nothing else would have caught it.
