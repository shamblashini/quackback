/**
 * Read-side server functions backing the post owner (assignee) control.
 *
 * The picker and the current-owner chip need the team roster and the post's
 * current owner, but neither surface can lean on the member.view-gated admin
 * roster fn: a narrowly-scoped role can hold post.set_owner without holding
 * member.view. Both fns therefore gate on the exact capability the control
 * needs — post.set_owner — so query enablement lines up 1:1 with the editor's
 * render gate, and the public portal post payload never has to grow an owner
 * field (the owner is fetched here, permission-gated, only when a team member
 * loads the page).
