/**
 * The application cache, on Postgres.
 *
 * Successor to `lib/server/redis.ts`'s `cacheGet`/`cacheSet`/`cacheDel`.
 * The call sites are unchanged: same three
 * helpers, same key table, same "a cache failure is a cache miss" contract.
 * What changed is where a row lands — `kv_store` in the workspace's own database
 * instead of a `t:<workspaceKey>:` key in a shared Redis.
 *
 * ## Failures are swallowed, deliberately, and that has a sharper edge here
 *
 * Every helper below logs and continues. That was already true of the Redis
 * version and the callers depend on it — `settings.service.ts` reads through
 * this on the SSR hot path and must not 500 because a cache is unavailable.
 *
 * The edge: under pooled tenancy `db` throws `WorkspaceScopeMissingError` when
 * there is no workspace scope, where Redis would have quietly used the `_`
 * namespace. So a cache call from an unscoped background context now degrades
 * to a permanent miss rather than reading a shared namespace. That is the
 * correct direction — a miss is slow, a shared namespace is one workspace's
 * settings served to another — but it means "the cache stopped working" is a
 * real state to look for in a new background subsystem, and the warn below is
 * where it shows up.

 * Logical cache key names.

 * These are the strings that reach the `key` column verbatim. The workspace
 * discriminator is NOT part of them — it is `kv_store.workspace_key`, the leading
 * column of the primary key, written by `pg-kv.ts` from
 * `currentWorkspaceNamespace()`.
 *
 * That is a stronger arrangement than the prefix it replaces, for the reason
 * the old comment here gave: half of these names are built by concatenation at
 * the call site (`PRINCIPAL_BY_USER`, the SSO-test session keys, the
 * link-preview and unfurl keys), so a namespace applied by string building was
 * always one `${'settings:workspace'}:extra` away from being bypassed. A key
 * column cannot be bypassed by concatenation; the worst a malformed key can do
 * is collide with another key of the same workspace.
