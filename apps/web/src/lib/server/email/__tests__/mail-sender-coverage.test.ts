/**
 * Every mail template must be classified by where its FROM comes from.
 *
 * This is `mail-class-coverage.test.ts`'s twin, on the other end of the
 * envelope, and it exists for the same reason. On a fleet, one mail provider
 * account signs for every workspace, so the From is a claim about which
 * workspace is speaking that the provider will carry out without checking. The
 * only thing that checks it is the sending-identity guard, and a new sender
 * that accepts a From typed as a plain string is the moment that guard becomes
 * optional — copy an adjacent caller, pass the address a row happened to hold,
 * done, and the impersonation ships green.
 *
 * Two things are pinned, because neither implies the other:
 *
 *  1. **Every sender is classified.** A new `send*Email` export is a decision
 *     about whether it may leave as anything other than the platform's own
 *     address, and this fails CI until someone states it.
 *  2. **Every `from` in the sender module is the branded type.** The class list
 *     records an intention; this checks the declaration that enforces it.
 *     `SendingIdentity` is minted in exactly one module — the guard — so a
 *     sender that demands one cannot be handed an unchecked address by any
 *     caller, in any file, through any import style. A `from?: string` would
 *     silently reopen that.
 *
 * `platform` is the safe default and needs no guard: omitting `from` means the
 * install's own configured sender, which every install is entitled to use.
