/**
 * Ticket TTR sweeps (support platform §4.6) — the scan/claim twins of
 * ticket-sla.service.ts's lazy recorders, split out of that module to keep
 * both under the domain max-lines budget. The ticket TTR clock gets its own
 * skeleton here rather than widening sla.sweep.ts's conversation sweeps:
 * the conversation skeleton is bound to the conversations table and iterates
 * a three-clock descriptor table, while a ticket carries exactly ONE clock —
 * a small parallel skeleton reads cleaner than a table-polymorphic one. All
 * three twins keep the conversation side's invariants (see its docs): SQL
 * only narrows the scan, the recording/claiming rule lives in JS, and every
 * stamp write is the shared guarded jsonb-merge (commitTicketStamp) every
 * other stamp writer uses, so a lazy settle, a pause/resume, or a re-apply
 * racing the sweep can never produce a duplicate event or clobber a newer
 * stamp.
 *
 * Wiring + claim ordering (mirroring the conversation side — see
 * sla.sweep.ts's module doc):
 *  - sweepOverdueTicketSlaBreaches rides the per-minute
 *    sla-breach-sweep-queue tick (the REPORTING axis): claims the breach-noted
 *    marker and appends the sla_events row, atomically in one transaction;
 *  - sweepApproachingTicketSlaBreaches / sweepTicketSlaBreachTriggers ride
 *    workflow-sweep.ts's 5-minute sweepSlaTimerTriggers (the workflow-TRIGGER
 *    axis): they scan candidates WITHOUT claiming, and the fire-once marker
 *    is claimed by the caller only AFTER the candidate's dispatch was
 *    successfully enqueued (claim-after-enqueue — see
 *    claimTicketSlaTimerTriggerMarker's doc). Dispatch needs the ticket's
 *    linked CUSTOMER conversation, so back-office tickets are never returned
 *    as candidates; their marker is claimed inline instead — see
 *    resolveTicketTriggerTarget.
