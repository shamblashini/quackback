/**
 * SLA breach sweeper — a per-minute job that records breaches for conversations
 * whose stamped deadline has passed with no settling event (see
 * sweepOverdueSlaBreaches). The lazy evaluator in sla.event-hooks.ts only fires
 * on agent reply / close, so without this sweep a conversation that blows its
 * deadline in silence would never be marked breached. The ticket-anchored TTR
 * clock (ticket-sla.sweep.ts's sweepOverdueTicketSlaBreaches) runs in the same
 * job: its lazy evaluator only fires on ticket status changes, so a ticket that
 * blows its deadline with no status move needs the sweep just the same.
 *
 * Runs on the Postgres job queue (`lib/server/jobs`). Schedule and retry policy
 * live in `jobs/definitions.ts`.
 *
 * The sweep modules are imported STATICALLY. They used to be `await import(...)`
 * inside the handler, which is a scope hazard rather than a style choice: the
 * tier opens a workspace scope around every pass, so a call-time import runs the
 * imported module's top level under whichever workspace happened to trigger it
 * first. `primeJobHandlers()` loads this module before any scope is open, and
 * static imports are what make that cover the modules the work actually lives
 * in. `__tests__/handler-imports.test.ts` keeps it that way.

 * The earliest SLA clock this workspace has that is still running unsettled — or
 * null, if it has none.
 *
 * Four clocks across two tables, and each arm restates its sweep's own eligible
 * condition rather than approximating it: a clock is a candidate only while its
 * due instant is set, its settled marker is unset and its breached marker is
 * unset. An arm that dropped one of those tests would report a deadline for a
 * clock that has already been answered, which costs a wake; an arm that added
 * one would hide a clock that has not, which costs a breach going unnoticed. The
 * second is the one that matters, so the conditions are copied verbatim.
 *
 * `paused_at` is honoured for the same reason `scanSlaClockCandidates` honours
 * it: a paused clock is not counting down, so its stored due instant is not a
 * deadline.
 *
 * The due values are ISO-8601 strings inside a JSON column, which compare
 * lexicographically exactly as they compare chronologically — the property
 * `sla.sweep.ts` already relies on for its window predicate.
