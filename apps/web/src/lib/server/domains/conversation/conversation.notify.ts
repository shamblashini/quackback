/**
 * Offline notifications for support-inbox conversations. Fire-and-forget from the service after a
 * write commits — a delivery failure must never break sending a message.
 *
 * Because it is fire-and-forget, a failed send has no caller to roll back: the
 * message row is already committed. Thread-addressed channels (GitHub) mark
 * that row pending at insert and move it to sent/failed once the provider
 * answers, so the inbox can show ticks instead of a silent drop. Visitor-facing
 * email still goes through a small bounded retry (see sendWithRetry) to convert
 * the common transient provider failure into a success rather than a log line
 * nobody reads. A send that exhausts the retries is still only logged.
 *
 *  - Visitor message  -> email the team only when no agent currently has a
 *    live stream (offline coverage). The in-app team bell for the same
 *    event rides the message.created event/hook pipeline instead (WO-3
 *    slice 5) — see notifyVisitorMessage's own doc.
 *  - Agent reply      -> email the visitor when they're reachable AND either
 *    offline OR on an EMAIL conversation. Presence gates the messenger surface
 *    only: on an email thread the mailbox IS the thread, so a live stream
 *    elsewhere is no evidence the reply was seen (see notifyAgentReply). An
 *    anonymous visitor with no captured address stays unreachable either way.

 * two mails that neither dedupe in the client nor thread together. That holds

 * own and rejects a caller-supplied header, every attempt necessarily carries a
 * different id, so the transport reopens that window whatever this loop does:
 * only the id of the attempt that RETURNS is recorded, and a mail delivered by
 * an earlier attempt is unroutable by Message-ID. Not retrying an error that
 * declares itself permanent is what narrows the window here, and what keeps a

 * conversation, conversation.email-cold-inbound.ts, and PROMOTED onto any thread
 * whose customer replies by mail — see sendVisitorMessage's channel write). The
 * in-app emoji row is inert in an email client,
 * so this sends a parallel email with real, one-click emoji links
 * (packages/email's csat-request template) — action.executor.ts's send_block
 * csat case calls this (via a dynamic import, to keep the rarely-hit path out
 * of that module's static graph) right after posting the block in-app.
 *
 * Reuses this module's own "email the visitor offline" recipient resolution
 * (the same principal/user join + resolveReplyRecipient every notify*
 * function above uses) rather than a separate lookup living in the workflows
 * domain. `promptText` is the block's already-interpolated body, pre-rendered
 * to plain text by the caller (action.executor.ts owns the TipTap ->
 * text conversion for every block kind already; this module has no other
 * reason to depend on that).
 *
 * Best-effort by design, same contract as every other notify* function here:
 * a failure (no deliverable recipient, an email provider outage, ...) must
 * never fail the block send that already posted in-app, so every failure is
 * caught and logged rather than propagated.
