/**
 * Cold-inbound sender resolution (support platform §4.8 Layer 2). When an email
 * arrives that isn't a reply to an existing conversation, this decides WHO it is
 * from, gated by the DMARC trust verdict and the decided identity model
 * (IDENTITY-MODEL-ANALYSIS.md): inbound email attaches by address only under a
 * DMARC pass ("verified lead"); anything weaker becomes a standalone unverified
 * lead.
 *
 *   - attach → an existing principal already owns this address: either a DMARC
 *              pass matching a known user account (a verified lead adopting a
 *              known contact), or a lead we minted from an earlier mail. Reusing
 *              the lead is what lets a block on a cold sender actually hold.
 *   - create → a new anonymous principal carrying the (verified-or-not) contact
 *              email; `unverified` drives the agent-facing "unverified sender"
 *              badge and blocks silent attachment to a known identity.
 *
 * A hard DMARC reject resolves like any other weak verdict rather than being
 * refused here. What a reject decides is the DISPOSITION of the message (the
 * caller quarantines it), and disposition is not this function's job — the
 * message still has to be attributed to somebody in order to be retained and
 * reviewed at all. Identity is not weakened by that, and the reason is
 * structural rather than a promise: `pass` is the only branch below that can
 * adopt an existing account, `verdict.verdict === 'pass'` guards it, and a
 * reject verdict can never satisfy that test. Everything a reject can reach
 * mints or reuses an anonymous lead and sets `unverified`.
 *
 * Resolution only touches identity; the caller owns creating the conversation.

/**
 * Create a fresh email conversation from a cold inbound message: the conversation
 * (channel='email', source='email', pinned to the inbound route, waiting on a
 * reply, unverified-sender badge when the auth was weak) + its first visitor
 * message, then fire conversation.created and message.created (first message) —
 * the second being what the team bell, message-triggered workflows and the
 * next-response SLA clock all ride, so an emailed-in thread raises the same
 * signals a widget-started one does. Direct inserts (the visitor-message create
 * path hardcodes channel='messenger'); the emit bridge is error-isolated.
 *
 * `quarantine` inverts both halves of that for a message we REFUSED. It files
 * the thread to Spam in the same INSERT, and it fires neither emit.
 *
 * Filing in the insert rather than with a follow-up update is what makes the
 * refusal hold: there is no instant at which a refused message sits in the open
 * queue, and no second write whose failure would leave it there. Going through
 * the ordinary spam filter instead would reintroduce exactly that, and worse —
 * that path is bypassed for a workspace-trusted sender, so a stranger spoofing
 * a trusted address would land in the normal inbox, which is the one outcome a
 * hard reject exists to prevent.
 *
 * The emits are skipped for the same reason. A refused message must not ring
 * the team bell, fire outbound webhooks, start an SLA clock, or trigger a
 * message workflow — an auto-reply workflow firing on a forged From is
 * backscatter sent in our name, and a bell any stranger can ring is a
 * notification channel we have handed to them.
