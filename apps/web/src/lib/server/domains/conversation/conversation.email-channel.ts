/**
 * Inbound email channel config + plus-address routing, kept pure so it's
 * unit-tested directly. Outbound agent-reply emails set a conversation-specific
 * Reply-To; the inbound front door reads that plus-address back to route a reply
 * into the right conversation.
 *
 * ## The grammar
 *
 * ```
 *   support / cold inbound    <slug>@<domain>
 *   conversation reply        <slug>+c<id-suffix>.<tag>@<domain>
 *   ticket reply              <slug>+t<id-suffix>.<tag>@<domain>
 * ```
 *
 * `<slug>` is the workspace's mail slug, and it is in the address because one
 * inbound domain can serve an entire fleet. Conversation and ticket ids live in
 * per-workspace databases, so an address that names only an id cannot be
 * resolved by anything that does not already know which workspace to ask; the
 * slug is what a front door in front of many workspaces routes on. It is
 * supplied by the caller rather than derived here, because what identifies a
 * workspace to a mail server is a shorter and stricter thing than what
 * identifies it to the rest of the system — see {@link MAX_MAIL_SLUG_LENGTH}.
 *
 * There is exactly one reading of an address. A caller with no slug to give gets
 * no address at all rather than an unslugged variant: the send then goes out
 * without a Reply-To and the email footer points at the portal thread, which is
 * the behaviour every caller already has for an unconfigured inbound channel.
 *
 * `<tag>` is an HMAC over the slug AND the id together, so a third party who
 * received one of our reply emails cannot forge a reply-to for an arbitrary
 * conversation and inject messages as another visitor. Both halves are signed
 * because the secret is fleet-wide: a tag over the id alone would still verify
 * after the slug beside it was rewritten, which would make one leaked reply
 * address a fleet-wide capability wearing a workspace-shaped label. A transport
 * signature only proves the mail was forwarded to us, never the SMTP sender's
 * identity, which is why the address has to carry its own proof. The marker
 * character (`c` / `t`) is what keeps the two families from being read as one
 * another.
 *
 * Only the TypeID suffix is embedded, not the full `conversation_<suffix>` id:
 * the prefix is constant, so carrying it would burn 13 characters of the RFC
 * 5321 64-char local-part budget for no routing value. The parser re-attaches
 * it. The HMAC is still taken over the full id.
 *
 * ## The budget
 *
 * RFC 5321 caps a local part at {@link MAX_LOCAL_PART_LENGTH}. Everything after
 * the slug spends 51 of them (`+`, marker, 26-char TypeID suffix, `.`, 22-char
 * tag), which is what leaves the slug 13 and no more — {@link MAX_MAIL_SLUG_LENGTH}
 * is that subtraction rather than a number that has to be kept in step by hand.
 * Over the ceiling and the address is one a receiving mail server is entitled to
 * reject, so minting refuses.
 *
 * ## Mail sent before a workspace had a mail slug
 *
 * A reply to one of those does not route by address: the address it is replying
 * to names no workspace and carries no tag this module can check. It still
 * routes when the reply quotes a Message-ID recorded against the conversation,
 * which is the fallback the ingest core tries next (In-Reply-To / References).
 * When neither matches, the mail is cold inbound — it opens a new conversation
 * from the sender's address instead of appending to the old thread. The ticket
 * family has no Message-ID fallback of its own, so a reply to a pre-slug ticket
 * notification always lands as a new conversation.
 *
 * That is the designed behaviour of a grammar with one reading, not a gap in it.
 * An address whose workspace cannot be named is not routable by a front door
 * standing in front of many workspaces, and the alternative to declining is
 * guessing which workspace's data to write a stranger's mail into.

/**
 * Further domains this install RECEIVES on and never mints on. Comma- or
 * whitespace-separated; unset is the ordinary single-domain install.
 *
 * Two values rather than one list, because the two halves of a domain change
 * have different lifetimes. MINTING moves in a single step: from the moment
 * {@link INBOUND_DOMAIN_ENV} changes, every new reply address is on the new
 * domain and no address on the old one is ever produced again. ACCEPTING cannot
 * move at all. Every address ever minted is still sitting in somebody's mail
 * client and still routes a reply, so a domain that stops being accepted leaves
 * each of those arriving at a door that refuses it — mail nobody has, waiting on
 * a replay queue for somebody to notice — and that population only grows,
 * because a reply address is read months after it was sent.
 *
 * So the accept-set is the mint domain plus this list, and this list is only
 * ever added to. A domain change is then a swap of two values with both domains
 * inside the accept-set at every instant, rather than a window in which one of
 * them refuses mail. A single list with the first entry minting would make the
 * same change a REORDER, where a typo silently moves minting instead of
 * widening the door.
 *
 * The mint domain is deliberately NOT split on commas. It names one domain, and
 * an install that put a list there would mint addresses on a domain that does
 * not exist. One value, one meaning, in every reader — and a value that names
 * more than one is refused rather than half-understood; see
 * {@link inboundMintDomain}.
 *
 * ## What listing a domain here costs, and who pays it
 *
 * Membership is not free, and none of the three costs falls on the operator who
 * types it. Each is stated at the reader that imposes it; together they are the
 * rule for what may be listed at all: a zone this platform OPERATES, retired
 * from minting but still ours.
 *
 * 1. No customer may ever verify that zone, its subtree, or any zone ABOVE it as
 *    their own sending domain. The list only grows in practice, so the set of
 *    zones no customer may use grows with it — and the customer who is refused
 *    never sees why. See `platformSendingDomains`.
 * 2. On an install that serves ONE workspace, inbound mail whose `Message-ID`
 *    sits on it is suppressed as that workspace's own mail looping back, with
 *    nothing retained. A pooled fleet reads no host that way, since a shared
 *    host names no workspace. See {@link ownMessageIdDomains}.
 * 3. Nothing else. In particular it grants no workspace the right to SEND from
 *    the domain: that is a claim about a verified provider identity, which only
 *    the minting domain has, and the send guard asks for the minting domain
 *    alone.
 *
 * ## It has to survive a deploy
 *
 * The value is set out of band, and infrastructure-as-code that does not declare
 * this variable DELETES it on the next apply. That is not a cosmetic loss: the
 * accept-set narrows back to the minting domain, and every reply address on the
 * retired one starts being refused by a front door that no longer answers for
 * it. Declare it wherever fleet variables are declared, even when it is empty.

 * with no retention and nobody to notice. That is the same mistake as adopting a
 * sending provider's regional host, one level in. Two things answer the question

 * Did THIS workspace mint one of the addresses in this header value?

 * The evidence the mail-loop guard runs on. It exists because authorship used to
 * be readable off a `Message-ID` — we minted the id, so its host was a domain we
 * operate — and a sending provider that assigns its own id ends that. The host
 * on the wire then belongs to the PROVIDER and is shared with every other
 * account on its region, so it is evidence of nothing: a guard keyed on it would
 * read any of that provider's customers' mail as our own and refuse it. That is
 * why this asks about an address we minted and not about the host an id happens
 * to wear.
 *
 * Three conditions, and dropping any one of them puts somebody else's mail
 * inside the answer:
 *
 * 1. THE TAG VERIFIES. Without it the answer is reachable by typing an address
 *    out, and the grammar is public.
 * 2. THE LABEL IS THIS WORKSPACE'S. The signing secret is fleet-wide, so a
 *    neighbouring workspace's address verifies against it perfectly. Their mail
 *    forwarded into this inbox is a stranger's mail here, and refusing it is the
 *    same mistake as trusting the provider's host, one level in.
 * 3. THE DOMAIN IS ONE WE RECEIVE ON. The tag covers the local part alone, so
 *    without this an address wearing our local part at any domain at all would
 *    answer yes.
 *
 * Both families, because both are mail we send and either can come back.
 *
 * What it does NOT prove is that the sender is us: anyone we have ever emailed
 * holds one of these addresses and can put it in a header. What it does prove is
 * the narrower thing the guard is entitled to act on: this is a message composed
 * against an address only this workspace could have minted.
 *
 * NOR DOES IT ASK WHICH conversation. Any minted address of this workspace
 * satisfies it, including one belonging to a thread this message has nothing to
 * do with — so anyone ever CC'd on one of our mails holds a value that answers
 * yes. Left that way deliberately, and the reason is what the caller does with
 * the answer: this signal RETAINS the message (files it to Spam under an
 * enumerated cause) rather than destroying it, so a wrong yes costs a thread in
 * a review queue instead of somebody's mail. Narrowing it would mean requiring
 * the message's own threading chain to resolve to the same conversation, which a
