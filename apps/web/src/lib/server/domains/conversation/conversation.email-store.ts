 * span that gap, and this is the mechanism the route home rests on: nothing
 * anywhere stores a host that was inferred rather than observed, so no reply is
 * ever lost to a guess about one.
 *
 * Deliberately narrow, and not a general "match on the local part" rule. The
 * extra candidate is only produced for an id whose host is the PROVIDER's and
 * which carries exactly one `@`, so the local part offered is a whole
 * provider-assigned id rather than a fragment of some longer one. Ids we mint
 * keep their host, so no workspace's id loses the domain that distinguishes it
 * from another's. Both candidates are still exact equality against a row this
 * workspace recorded itself, so nothing here widens what can match.
 *
 * The vocabulary of provider hosts is not restated here: it lives in one module
 * that the transport composing those hosts imports too, so a change to either

 *
 * The caller decides WHICH id that is: the one we minted on a transport that
