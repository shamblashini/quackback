/**
 * What the cold-inbound store FILES a message under.
 *
 * The read side of cold-inbound dedupe is exercised through the ingest core; this
 * is the write, and the pair only holds if the two spend the same derivation.
 * The consequence of them drifting apart is the worst one this path has: a cold
 * message opens a THREAD rather than appending to one, so a redelivery that
 * fails to match the row it should have matched does not duplicate a message, it
 * opens a second conversation with a second first-contact notification. The edge
 * bridge redelivers a whole message when any one of its recipients faults, so
 * that is an ordinary event rather than a rare one.
 *
 * The db is a recorder rather than a stub: the values the insert actually bound
 * are what is asserted, so a store that stopped stamping the key — or stamped a
 * different one — fails here rather than passing on a read-side test that never
 * exercised it.
