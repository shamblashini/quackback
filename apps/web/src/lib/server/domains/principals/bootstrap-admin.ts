/**
 * The bootstrap-admin invariant, in one place.
 *
 * A workspace hands out its first admin exactly once, and more than one code
 * path can be the one that does it (the onboarding workspace step, and an SSO
 * callback recovering a workspace whose admin is gone). Those paths only
 * exclude each other if they agree on three things, so all three live here:
 *
 *  - the advisory-lock key they serialise on. Two different keys are two
 *    different locks, which is the same as no lock at all.
 *  - what counts as an owner. A human principal (`type: 'user'`) holding
 *    `admin`. Service principals are excluded so a config-file-provisioned API
 *    key cannot block the first real person from claiming setup.
 *  - whether arriving at all is a claim. On an install nobody provisioned the
 *    first human genuinely is the owner; on a workspace a control plane created
 *    for a named customer, being first through the door is a race anyone who
 *    can guess a hostname may enter. See {@link isOpenToBootstrapClaim}.
 *
 * The onboarding promoter also asks a fourth, {@link isSetupOpenToClaim}: the
 * workspace step is for finishing setup, so a workspace whose setup is done
 * is not claimable there. The SSO callback does not ask it, because recovering
 * a workspace whose admin is gone is what that path is for, and it already
 * requires an address at a domain this provider verified.
 *
 * On an install whose setup is still open, the onboarding promoter decides one
 * thing more: who claimed it. That is the first human account created there
 * ({@link findSetupClaimant}), not whoever reaches the workspace step first,
 * because the gap between creating an account and finishing that step is a
 * window in which a second visitor could otherwise take the install. The
 * server's operator can name a different owner instead, with
 * `SETUP_OWNER_EMAIL` ({@link namedSetupOwnerEmail}).
 *
 * Two promoters, and both consult all three: `functions/onboarding.ts`'s
 * `ensureBootstrapAdmin` and `auth/hooks.ts`'s `handleSsoCallbackAfter`. The
 * second one used to consult only the first two, which produced the
 * disagreement in its worst direction — the screen told the browser the
 * workspace was not open to claim while the SSO path promoted the first
 * arrival anyway.
 *
 * The claim the unauthenticated first screen reads uses the same predicates, so
 * the screen can never say "unclaimed" while a promoter says "claimed" (that
 * disagreement is what leaves a visitor filling in a form that then refuses
 * them). A blocked admin still owns setup for the same reason: the promoter
 * counts them, so the screen must too.

 *
 * No on a workspace a control plane created. Such a workspace already belongs
 * to a named customer before anyone signs in, its hostname sits under a domain

 * therefore a search rather than a guess. Its owner is recorded where it was

 * {@link isProvisionedWorkspace}. Cloud is off by default in this codebase and
 * nothing here learns otherwise.
 *
