/**
 * The `file-retention` job: remove stored files nothing can reach any more.
 *
 * Two kinds of file qualify:
 *
 *  - NEVER SENT. An upload writes its row before any message exists, so a
 *    file still unattached a day later was abandoned (a composer closed, a
 *    chip removed). A day is long enough that a file uploaded while a reply is
 *    being written is never touched.
 *  - ORPHANED. A file whose first message was deleted for good (a conversation
 *    deleted permanently, spam retention) has its `message_id` cleared by the
 *    foreign key. A later message may still carry it (a ticket that copied the
 *    attachment), so it is removed only when no remaining message's
 *    attachments name it.
 *
 * A send can link a file at any moment, so each file is CLAIMED before any
 * object goes: one UPDATE sets `deleted_at` only while the row still
 * qualifies, and a file a send linked first is left alone. From the claim on,
 * a send that reads the row is told the file is gone (`FILE_EXPIRED`), and a
 * send that already read it fails when it links it (`linkFilesToMessage`
 * re-reads the row under a lock, so the two cannot both win). An orphaned
 * file's references are checked again after its claim, in a statement that
 * sees every message committed before it; one a message now carries is
 * released.
 *
 * Then the objects go. A storage failure releases the claim (clears
 * `deleted_at` back), so the file stays usable and the next run retries it.
 * A process that dies between the claim and the release leaves a deleted row
 * whose objects remain: nothing mints a link for them any more, so the cost is
 * storage, never a file served after its row said it was gone. Once the
 * objects are gone the row stays as a tombstone (name, size, hash) with the
 * derived content (preview meta, text excerpt) cleared, since it came from
 * the bytes that are gone.
 *
 * Only `files/` objects are ever deleted. A row or preview key that names
 * anything else is left for whoever owns it.
