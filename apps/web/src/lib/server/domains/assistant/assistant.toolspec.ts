/**
 * Build a catalogue entry from a tool definition plus its admin metadata.
 * `name` derives from the definition so the model-facing id and the registry
 * id can never drift, and the erasure to the registry's unknown-typed shape
 * lives here, in exactly one place, instead of a cast per entry.
 *
 * Generic over the concrete `definition` (`TDef`), so the compiler ties
 * `execute`/`summarize`/`idempotencyKey` straight to that definition's OWN
 * schemas: `args` is the definition's inferred input (`InferToolInput<TDef>`)
 * and `execute`'s return is the definition's success output
 * (`ToolSuccessOutput<TDef>` — the outputSchema minus the gate envelopes the
 * pipeline adds later). A tool whose execute reads a field the input schema
 * doesn't declare, or returns a shape the output schema doesn't admit, no
 * longer compiles — no per-tool `<In, Out>` to hand-align. The single erasure
 * to the heterogeneous registry type (`AssistantToolSpec` with unknown args)
 * stays here at the return, so the registry can still hold every tool in one
 * `Record` while each entry was checked against its real schemas above.
