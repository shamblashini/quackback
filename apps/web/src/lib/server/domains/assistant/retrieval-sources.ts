 * Source-adapter seam for Quinn's grounding retrieval.
 *
 * `search` used to call the knowledge base directly (the only
 * grounding source that existed). This module generalizes that into a
 * `KnowledgeSource` per grounding source — the knowledge base always,
 * feedback posts, admin-curated snippets, and the same customer's own
 * past-conversation summaries each behind their own flag — composed by
 * `retrieveKnowledge` into one ranked, budgeted result.
 *
 * Which sources are registered for a turn is decided by the resolved agent's
 * per-agent `knowledge` map (config v3), compiled to a set of enabled source
 * types (`AssistantKnowledgeSnapshot`) by `resolveAssistantKnowledgeSnapshot`.
 * A source whose type is not in that set is not registered — it does not exist
 * to the agent this turn (D7). Each optional source's domain is pulled via a
 * lazy import so this module never eagerly loads a disabled source's schema.
 * With only the knowledge-base source registered (the KB-only default),
 * `retrieveKnowledge` is a byte-identical pass-through of
 * `retrieveKbArticles`'s own ranking — merging and re-ranking a single
 * source's already-sorted output changes nothing.

 *
 * The merge is rank-based interleaving, NOT a sort on raw scores: score
 * scales are incommensurable across sources by construction (KB ts_rank
 * values sit well below 1 on the keyword fallback, cosine similarities span
 * ~0.35-0.9, and the ILIKE fallbacks have no relevance signal at all), so a
 * raw-score sort lets whichever source happens to use the largest scale crowd
 * every other source out of the budget whenever scales diverge — e.g. with
 * embeddings down, summaries used to bury KB articles entirely. A score IS
 * self-consistent within its own source, so each source's items are ranked by
 * their own score there; across sources, every source's #1 outranks any
 * source's #2 (and so on), with raw score only breaking ties WITHIN a rank
 * tier for a stable, continuity-preserving order. Rank interleaving is
 * structural — no per-source scale calibration exists to drift when a
 * source's scoring changes.
 *
 * A zero score is the one cross-source-comparable value: it means "no
 * relevance signal at all" (an ILIKE fallback hit), not "this source's own
 * scale of relevant". Zero-score rows therefore never compete in the rank
 * tiers — every scored row from every source seats first, then zero-score
 * rows append (in each source's own order) to fill whatever budget remains,
 * so a source degraded to its fallback can pad the result but never displace
 * another source's genuinely-scored items.
 *
 * `sourceTypes`, when given, is a per-request NARROWING filter applied after
 * `resolveKnowledgeSources()`: it can only drop sources the snapshot already
 * registered, never add one back the agent's config left unregistered (the
 * copilot Answer-sources picker, intersected with any model-supplied `sources`
 * target, is the caller; it lets a teammate turn a source off for one
 * question, not turn on a source the workspace hasn't enabled). `undefined`
