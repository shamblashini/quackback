/**
 * Shared transcript rendering + budgeting for Quinn's grounding and summary
 * paths. A thread (oldest-first) renders to plain "Speaker: content" lines; a
 * rendered transcript can then be bounded to a char budget with a head+tail
 * window so a long thread never silently loses its opening messages.
 *
 * One definition, two consumers:
 *   - `assistant.runtime.ts` — the copilot turn's ticket AND conversation
 *     grounding blocks (`buildTicketTranscript` / `buildConversationTranscript`,
 *     each then passed through `budgetTranscript`).
 *   - `conversation-summary.service.ts` — the on-close summary and the on-demand
 *     Summarize chip (conversation via `buildConversationTranscript`, ticket via
 *     `buildTicketTranscript`).
 *
 * The two renderers are intentionally byte-identical (a conversation message and
 * a ticket message are the same `ConversationMessageDTO` shape); they stay
 * separately named so each call site reads for what it grounds on.
 *
 * Internal-note labelling (copilot grounding, D1): an internal note is labelled
 * `Note (internal):` rather than `Agent:` so the model can tell a teammate-only
 * note from a customer-visible message. A note only ever reaches these renderers
 * when the caller loaded the thread with `includeInternal` — the copilot
 * grounding block does; the summary paths load notes-free, so the label branch
 * never fires there and a note can never leak into a persisted summary.
