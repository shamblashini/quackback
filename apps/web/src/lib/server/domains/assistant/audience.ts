/**
 * Content-audience classification for anything Quinn can retrieve and cite.
 *
 * `AssistantSurface` (widget/email/workflow_step/copilot) is the ONLY signal
 * that distinguishes a customer-facing turn from a teammate-facing one —
 * `quinnActor` is always a 'service' principal, so `principalType` cannot be
 * used for this. `resolveContentAudience` is the single mint point for any
 * audience above 'public': every other piece of code that needs a
 * `ContentAudience` must go through it (or through a value that already came
 * from it), never construct one from a raw string literal. That is the
 * structural leak gate — as long as nothing else produces 'team' or
 * 'internal', a customer-facing surface can never retrieve or cite
 * teammate-only or internal-only knowledge, regardless of prompt discipline.
 *
 * This is deliberately its own type from `HelpCenterAudience`
 * ('public' | 'team', help-center-search.service.ts). That type is a
 * retrieval-scope parameter with a wide blast radius — it also gates the
 * public help-center's own search and Ask AI routes — and widening it to add
 * 'internal' would ripple through code that has nothing to do with the
 * assistant. `toHelpCenterAudience` maps at the boundary instead, so KB
 * retrieval keeps its narrower, already-audited type untouched.
