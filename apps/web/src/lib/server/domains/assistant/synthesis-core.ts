/**
 * Shared synthesis engine behind Quinn's tool-using turn (assistant.runtime.ts)
 * and Ask AI's one-shot answer (synthesis.ts). Both are thin wrappers around
 * one parameterized core: a chat()-stream delta-diffing skeleton, JSON
 * salvage plumbing, and a small retry harness.
 *
 * Everything that differs between the two today is an explicit option rather
 * than something this module decides on its own: the error contract
 * (`onFailure`), salvage strictness (`salvageMode` + a caller `salvage` fn),
 * whether tools are wired in at all (`tools: null | {...}`), and how an
 * attempt's outcome is classified for the usage log (`deriveAnswerKind`).
 * Output-schema validation and citation/guardrail post-processing
 * (assembleCitations/relinkCitations, validateAnswer) stay OUTSIDE this
 * module entirely: it only ever hands back the raw decoded-or-salvaged
 * structured object, never interprets it. A future caller (e.g. a
 * teammate-facing copilot with tools optionally on) is meant to be a new set
 * of options here, not a fork of this file.
