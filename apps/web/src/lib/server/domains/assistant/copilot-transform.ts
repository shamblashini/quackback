/**
 * Copilot transforms (P2-C.1, COPILOT-SIDEBAR-UX.md "What P2-C adds"):
 * tone/format rewrites over already-composed text. Two entry points drive it:
 * the answer card's "Add to composer & modify" menu (source = the streamed
 * answer text) and the composer's Improve menu (source = the teammate's
 * own draft). Both funnel through this one module.
 *
 * Calls the shared synthesis core (synthesis-core.ts) DIRECTLY with
 * `tools: null`, the same shape `synthesis.ts` uses for Ask AI's one-shot
 * answer: this is the third direct caller alongside it and the tool-using
 * turn (assistant.runtime.ts). No citations, no retrieval: the input text is
 * the entire context, so the output schema is just `{ text: string }`.
 *
 * `my_tone` is the one transform that needs extra context. It derives aggregate
 * style statistics from the teammate's recent outbound replies without sending
 * any prior customer's text to the model. A teammate with no prior
 * replies degrades to a neutral "match a professional, warm support voice"
 * instruction rather than failing or stalling.
