/**
 * Conversation-attribute value breakdown (C2.7 / AI-ATTRIBUTES-PARITY-SPEC.md
 * Phase 4): per-value conversation counts for one attribute over a date
 * range — the segmentation dimension both competitors' "reporting-ready
 * structure" pitch is built on, for human-set AND AI-set values alike.
 *
 * Deliberately the lightweight direct-query shape `sla-reporting.ts` /
 * `workflow-reporting.ts` use, not the materialized-view analytics pipeline
 * (`analytics.service.ts`'s hourly BullMQ rollup) — that pipeline's summary
 * shape is baked into a fixed set of matviews recomputed on a schedule, so
 * wiring an arbitrary admin-chosen attribute key into it is a much larger
 * change than this feature warrants for v1. A future iteration can promote
 * this into the dashboard's matview if per-key breakdowns need to sit
 * alongside the other Analytics sections; see the Phase 4 report for what's
 * deferred.
 *
 * Aggregation happens in application code rather than a SQL GROUP BY: a
 * multi_select value can contribute a conversation to several buckets at
 * once (one row can't GROUP BY into many buckets without an UNNEST/LATERAL
 * join), and folding the envelope-unwrap + array-unnest + legacy-bare-value
 * fallback into one portable SQL expression is far more fragile than doing
 * it in TypeScript once per row. Conversation volume in a date-range window
 * is the same order of magnitude other admin reads already pull (e.g. the
 * inbox list), so this stays cheap in practice; revisit with a GROUP BY if a
 * workspace's window ever gets large enough for it to matter.
