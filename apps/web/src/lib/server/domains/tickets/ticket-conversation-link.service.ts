/**
 * Link a ticket to the conversation it was created from (unified inbox §M5's
 * create-ticket flow): inserts the `ticket_conversations` join row, announces
 * the ticket on the conversation thread as a system event (mirrors
 * ticket-links.service.ts's tracker-link note, but on the CONVERSATION side),
 * and lets that same insert/publish keep any open inbox tab in sync.
 *
 * TWO KINDS OF LINK, one join row. A CUSTOMER ticket linked to a conversation
 * IS that conversation (the convergence pair): the two are one item, share a
 * thread, and every pair reader keys off `ticket_type = 'customer'`. Any other
 * type (a back-office task spun off the conversation, a tracker) links as
 * PROVENANCE only — the conversation it came from, kept — and the pair
 * semantics below stay switched off for it. `ticket_type` is denormalized from
 * the ticket at link time so both the partial uniques and every reader can
 * tell the two apart without a join.
 *
 * AUDIENCE (B17, decided with the convergence). For the pair the announcement
 * is for BOTH sides: on the converged shared thread it is the in-thread
 * conversion marker — the conversation's visitor IS the ticket's requester, so
 * "Ticket #N created from this conversation" tells them where their thread
 * went. Customer-facing clients (messenger, portal/widget ticket threads)
 * therefore LOCALIZE it from `metadata.systemEvent` (`kind: 'ticket_created'` +
 * `ticketReference`) via SystemEventNotice; the stored English `content` is
 * only the fallback for agent surfaces, email transcripts, and legacy/
 * unknown-kind rendering — never the display string a customer sees. A
 * provenance link announces TEAM-ONLY instead: internal work is never the
 * customer's business, and nothing about their own thread has changed.
 *
 * The pair is 1:1 (convergence Phase 0): the partial-unique indexes
 * (`ticket_conversations_customer_uq`, `ticket_conversations_customer_ticket_uq`)
 * allow at most one CUSTOMER ticket per conversation AND at most one
 * conversation per CUSTOMER ticket — a violation of either surfaces here as a
 * friendly `ConflictError` instead of a raw constraint violation should two
 * teammates race to link the same conversation or ticket. Both indexes are
 * partial, so provenance links are free-form: several per conversation, several
 * per ticket, and one repeated pair trips only the composite primary key, which
 * reads as the same friendly conflict.
 *
 * SLA handoff (support platform §4.6, "applied first time" semantics): when
 * the conversation has an active SLA whose policy tracks time-to-resolve, the
 * freshly linked CUSTOMER ticket starts its OWN TTR clock under that same
 * policy, ticking from the LINK instant (not the ticket's creation — the row
 * may precede the link by a dialog's worth of drafting). Best-effort like the
 * announcement: the link already landed, so a handoff failure is logged,
 * never surfaced to the caller. A provenance link hands nothing over: the
 * conversation still owns the customer promise, and a second clock on an
 * internal task would measure that promise against work the customer never
 * asked for.
 *
 * A NOTE CAN BE SENT BACK ALONG A PROVENANCE LINK (`crossPostTicketNote`).
 * Keeping the originating conversation is only half of what makes a spun-off
 * task useful: the teammate who later reads that conversation needs to know
 * what came of the task. So an internal note on a provenance-linked ticket can
 * be carried onto each conversation it was opened from, as an internal note of
 * its own — a per-note choice its author makes, never the default, since a
 * back-office thread is mostly the specialist's own working chatter and the
 * conversation is the customer's record. The pair is excluded — a customer
 * ticket and its conversation are one thread through the union read, so a
 * carried copy would show twice — and every carried note is stamped with its
 * origin ticket, which is what stops a note travelling in circles.
