/**
 * Ticket thread messages (support platform §4.2). A `customer` ticket is a
 * repliable two-way thread that reuses the polymorphic conversation_messages
 * table (a row with `ticket_id` set instead of `conversation_id`, since 0151).
 *
 * CONVERGENCE (scratchpad/convergence-design.md). A customer ticket and the
 * conversation it was created from are ONE thread. Phase 0 made the READ path
 * the pair union (`listTicketMessages` delegates to pair-thread.service.ts,
 * merging legacy ticket-parented rows with the linked conversation's
 * messages). Phase 1a — THIS module — converges the WRITE path at the
 * `insertTicketMessage` choke point. The three-path contract (mechanics
 * appendix "Write (Phase 1)"):
 *
 *   1. `insertTicketMessage` (agent reply, requester reply):
 *      - `isInternal` → stays `ticket_id`-parented; `addTicketNote` never
 *        redirects. A note whose author ASKS to share it
 *        (`shareWithConversation`, off by default) additionally carries a COPY
 *        onto each conversation the ticket links to as PROVENANCE —
 *        `crossPostTicketNote` in ticket-conversation-link.service.ts, which
 *        owns the pair exclusion and the loop stamp. A copy, never a
 *        re-parent: the note's home is still the ticket thread.
 *      - a CUSTOMER ticket with a linked conversation (resolved via
 *        `ticket_conversations`, ticket_type='customer') → the write lands on
 *        the CONVERSATION (`conversation_id`), running the FULL conversation
 *        write pipeline — not a bare row insert. The redirect delegates to the
 *        conversation domain's own send functions (`sendVisitorMessage` /
 *        `sendAgentMessage`, conversation.service.ts), which own
 *        `lastMessageAt`/`lastMessagePreview`, `waitingSince`, the read
 *        stamps, `emitMessageCreated` (so sla.event-hooks.ts settles FRT/NRT
 *        and resumes/re-arms on visitor messages), `publishConversationEvent`
 *        realtime, and notification dispatch. conversation.service.ts imports
 *        nothing from the tickets domain, so this delegation creates no cycle.
 *      - anything else (back-office/tracker, or a standalone customer ticket
 *        with no linked conversation — the pre-1b legacy case) → `ticket_id`
 *        as before.
 *   2. `postTicketStatusEvent` (ticket.service.ts, customer-visible stage
 *      system messages) — re-parents to the conversation on linked pairs;
 *      stays ticket-parented elsewhere.
 *   3. `emitTicketSystemMessage` (team-only internal system notes) — STAYS
 *      ticket-parented by definition; untouched by the redirect.
 *
 * Redirect invariants (all three hold whichever parent the row lands on):
 * `tickets.updatedAt` is still bumped (listMyTickets orders by it), the
 * realtime `ticket_message` still publishes on the team-only ticket channel
 * (dual-publish — the conversation channel copy is the delegate's), and the
 * ticket's `firstResponseAt` column is deliberately NOT stamped by redirected
 * agent replies: at link time `linkTicketToConversation` backfills it from the
 * conversation's first agent message, and afterwards the conversation's
 * first-response machinery owns the timeline. The caller-side `ticket.replied`
 * emission (sendTicketMessage / appendRequesterReply) fires alongside the
 * delegate's `message.created` — the notification matrix's watcher fan-out.
 *
 * PHASE 1a/1b BOUNDARY: the redirect only governs writes on already-linked
 * pairs. Phase 1b (createTicketCore's `withBackingConversation` intake path)
 * creates the backing conversation + link in the intake transaction itself
 * and writes the opening message through this module, riding the same
 * redirect — nothing in this module changes for it.
 *
 * PHASE 3 — WATERMARK STATE: the pair's unread truth is the CONVERSATION's
 * two watermarks (`conversations.agent_last_read_at` /
 * `visitor_last_read_at`), which the redirected write pipeline already
 * maintains natively (an agent reply stamps the agent side, a requester
 * reply arms `waitingSince`). The legacy `tickets.*_last_read_at` columns are
 * legacy-read only for customer tickets — nothing writes them for a linked
 * pair anymore (mark-read delegates to the conversation's mark-read;
 * mark-unread from a legacy ticket-parented anchor moves the conversation's
 * agent watermark) — and stay live only for threads that kept their own
 * ticket-scoped messages (back-office/tracker, standalone customer).

 * `enrichMessagesForAgent` (unified inbox §2.5 — ticket messages now carry
 * reactions/flags too, see message.actions.ts). A sibling function rather
 * than a parameter on `listTicketMessages` because that fn's return type
 * (`TicketMessagePage`, bare `ConversationMessageDTO[]`) is also used by the
 * requester portal and the transcript export, neither of which may ever see
 * agent-only reaction/flag data — keeping them as two functions makes that
 * split a type-level guarantee instead of a runtime opt.  Quinn post-
 * suggestions and pending-action pointers don't exist on ticket threads yet,
 * hence the empty map.
