/**
 * Extract client IP from request headers.
 *
 * Accepts a full `Request` or just `Headers` — server functions only
 * have `Headers` via `getRequestHeaders()`, so the Headers overload
 * lets them call this without forging a synthetic Request. The `source`
 * parameter is unused when trustedHops === 0 (see below) but is kept so
 * every call site has one signature regardless of mode.
 *
 * With TRUSTED_CLIENT_IP_HEADER set, the address in that header is used when
 * it holds exactly one valid IP. It is for proxies that set or overwrite one
 * authoritative header (nginx `proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr`,
 * CF-Connecting-IP), which is the only reliable source when requests cross
 * several internal proxies of unknown count. The operator vouches that the
 * proxy never passes a client's copy through. A missing or unusable value
 * falls back to the rules below and logs a throttled warning.
 *
 * Otherwise, two resolution modes, chosen by TRUSTED_PROXY_HOPS:
 *
 * - hops === 0 (default, direct exposure): headers are entirely untrusted,
 *   since any client can set X-Forwarded-For/CF-Connecting-IP/X-Real-IP on
 *   a request they send us directly, and honoring them would let a single
 *   attacker spread requests across unlimited rate-limit buckets. Instead
 *   this resolves the actual TCP peer address via TanStack Start's
 *   getRequestIP(), which reads it from the platform connection rather
 *   than from any header. On the Bun preset this is backed by Bun's
 *   `server.requestIP()`, so distinct clients land in distinct buckets even
 *   with zero configured proxies.
 * - hops > 0 (behind N trusted reverse proxies): the client IP is the
 *   (hops)-th entry from the right of X-Forwarded-For, the standard
 *   trusted-hop model. Each trusted proxy appends the peer address it
 *   observed, so counting from the right lands on what the outermost
 *   trusted proxy actually saw regardless of how many untrusted entries a
 *   client prepends further left. Single-value headers like
 *   CF-Connecting-IP/X-Real-IP are not consulted here: unlike
 *   X-Forwarded-For's position-based trust, nothing in the request tells
 *   whether such a header was set by a trusted hop or relayed unmodified
 *   from the client. Only the operator knows, which is why reading one
 *   takes an explicit TRUSTED_CLIENT_IP_HEADER.
 *
 * All of these yield to a visitor address signed by the trusted edge proxy that
 * serves custom hostnames (see `edgeClientIp` in workspaces/saas-edge-host):
 * that proxy is the TCP peer and the last X-Forwarded-For hop of every such
 * request, so either rule alone would put all of its visitors in one bucket.
 * The signed address is honored only with QUACKBACK_SAAS_EDGE_SECRET set and
 * a verified customer host on the same request; otherwise both headers are
 * ignored and the rules above apply unchanged.
 *
 * Known limitation: getRequestIP() depends on the platform exposing the
 * socket peer address. That is true for the built Nitro/Bun server this
 * project ships (`bun run start`), but not guaranteed for every dev/test
 * runtime (e.g. `bun run dev`'s Vite dev server). When unavailable, this
 * falls back to the shared 'unknown' bucket, matching pre-existing
 * fail-safe behavior instead of trusting a spoofable header.
