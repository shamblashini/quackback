/**
 * Refuses to add another sending domain once the plan's `maxSendingDomains`

 *
 * The only count limit here that guards something outside this workspace.
 * Adding a sending domain creates an identity on the mail provider account
 * every workspace shares, and that account has an identity quota — so the
 * failure mode of no ceiling is not one workspace overspending its plan, it is
 * one workspace exhausting a resource the rest depend on.
 *
 * ## The count runs on the caller's executor, on purpose
 *
 * Every other limit here reads and throws, and the window between the read and
 * the create is harmless because the resource being overspent belongs to the
 * workspace overspending it. This one is different, so the caller passes the
 * transaction it is about to insert in and holds a lock across both — see
 * `createSendingDomain`, which is the only caller and the only insert path. The
 * limit is passed in for the same reason: reading it inside the transaction
 * would put a settings query inside a lock that nothing else needs to wait on.
 *
 * ## Why the default is still unlimited
 *
 * A self-hoster runs the whole provider account and every identity on it is
 * theirs; a ceiling there would be a number invented to constrain someone with
 * nobody to take the resource from. On a fleet the ceiling is not optional and
 * it is not a default: the control plane writes a `maxSendingDomains` into every
 * tenant's tier limits, and a tenant whose limits were never written can add
 * domains without one. That is the same posture as every other limit in this
 * file — the mechanism is shared and the values are the deployment's — and it
 * is why the fleet's provisioning path must write the value rather than rely on
 * anything here.
