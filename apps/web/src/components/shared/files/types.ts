/**
 * The contract between the file viewer's shell and its format engines.
 *
 * The shell owns everything a person should find the same whatever the format:
 * the header (badge, name, sender, time, size), moving through the gallery,
 * Download, Close, the keyboard, loading, and every failure state. An engine
 * owns only the content area: it renders the file and reports which toolbar
 * controls make sense for it (zoom, pages, find, wrap, a one-line note), and
 * the shell draws them, so the same control looks and behaves the same in
 * every engine.
